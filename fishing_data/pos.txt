Fishing with Rod: Stocking trout in the city Each spring, the Fraser Valley Trout Hatchery releases rainbow trout at catchable size (300 to 500g) into more than a dozen lakes near Vancouver, British Columbia. Funded by freshwater fishing licences, this program creates urban fisheries for families, anglers with disabilities and those who do not wish to travel too far. On April 13th 2010, we caught up with Kurt Vinge from the Fraser Valley Trout Hatchery, who released 250 rainbow trout into Deer Lake in Burnaby. Kurt talks about what anglers can expect from the catchable rainbow trout stocking program. For more information, please visit http://www.gofishbc.com.

Ice Fishing a Fun Winter Activity in Whistler Canada Ice Fishing a Fun Winter Activity in Whistler Canada.  The past few weeks we have been having some of the best Ice fishing for large fish in Canada, Large Bull Trout weighing between 5 - 10 LBS and with a length between 22" - 30".  Bull Trout in the lake that we are fishing reach a staggering 20 LBS and is uncommon to catch under 4 LBS.  When you are catching fish like this it makes for great videos and Pictures.  As of late we have developed a new Ice fishing jig that only catches large predatory Trout.  The Jig imitates large wounded bait fish to perfection.  It does not matter where we are fishing in the lake, it seems to attract them from afar.  That being said, we have been having best success near the middle of the lake because it seems to draw a larger audience.  The concept behind the "new" jig is simple, represent the bait that the fish are keying in on, present it the way that attracts them, then feed it to them.  It doesn't take long for them to come and investigate.  Anyone that says there is not a science to ice fishing hasn't Ice Fished with us.  We are always looking for that upper hand to provide a memorable experience for our clients.  If you are looking for a Fun Activity in Whistler, Canada, Ice fishing is the answer.  We put our clients on thousands of fish yearly while providing a safe, fun, educational and rewarding experience.  Our Ice fishing trips are great for Families, Friends and corporate outing.

On average the lakes have between 8" - 12" of quality ice.

British Columbia Salmon Extinction? A Reality Check. http://www.AquacultureFacts.org    Anti-salmon farming critics have repeated claims of wild salmon extinction in British Columbia. Is this true? Are salmon going extinct?    Not at all. Not even close. In fact, Fraser River Sockeye (near Vancouver) just returned in high numbers not seen in 100 years.    First the activists said salmon farms were driving the Pink salmon to extinction. But since these erroneous claims were made, Pink salmon have returned to BC rivers in record high numbers.    To divert attention away from record pink salmon returns, activists then said that the Fraser river sockeye were at risk - again because of BC salmon farms. But again, the 2010 return of sockeye salmon was the highest witnessed since 1913.     Activists such as Alexandra Morton and John Volpe have repeated these extinction claims - claims that were designed to tarnish the reputation of BC farm-raised salmon and ultimately threaten the livelihood of thousands of hard working British Columbians.     This video was produced to capture these claims and provide the public with the truth.

Helicopter fishing trips in British Columbia Canada with the Pemberton Fish Finder Helicopter fishing trips in British Columbia Canada with the Pemberton Fish Finder.  Plan on having one of the best days of your life.  The fishing in these alpine lakes are like no other for Rainbow Trout.  These fish have never seen hooks before, making them very eager to bit.  The Rainbow Trout in the alpine lake that we are fishing range in size from 14" - 24" and weigh as much as 3.5 LBS.  As soon as you set the hook the fish make Arial displays that show their incredible colors.  This lake is seldom visited because of there remoteness and there is zero evidence that anyone has been prior.  Let the thousand smells of alpine flowers hit you as soon as you step out of the helicopter.  The shear beauty and tranquility is overwhelming.  There are opportunities for short ridge hikes to gain spectacular views.  Lets not forget about the Helicopter ride through the endless snow topped mountains and glaciers.  Our helicopter has seating for 6 passengers plus luggage.  We provide all of the necessary fishing equipment and our guides are familiar with the alpine lake you choose to fish.  We either spin fish or Fly fish these remote lakes.  Expect to catch lots of fish!  Just 3 hours of fishing we landed roughly 40 Rainbow Trout.  That is roughly a fish every cast or every other cast.  Choose from either a full day or Half day Helicopter fishing charter from shore or float tube.  I assure you that a full day goes by very fast ;)  This is some of the best fishing in British Columbia, Canada.

Ivey lake is know as a trophy lake where Rainbow Trout can reach 30" and weigh as much as 8lbs.  Rainbow trout are caught easily by trolling flies, casting dry flies and by stripping large leech or Dragonfly patterns.

Ice fishing tours in British Columbia Canada Ice fishing tours in British Columbia Canada.  Most of the time I would get more video but the fishing was too good to put the rod down.  We had multiple double headers and a couple triple headers.  Most of the fish we were catching were Bull Trout and we caught one Rainbow Trout.  The Bull Trout had an average weight of 3.5 Lbs, with the odd one breaking 5 Lbs.  If you join us for an Ice fishing tour on this lake you best do a few Bicep and Tricep stretches the night before fishing.  Ice fishing doesn't get any better than this.  Between the 3 of us we caught roughly 120 fish in approximately 4 hours.  Enjoy the short Ice fishing video.

2015 Ice Fishing season started in Pemberton BC We are super excited to announce that the 2015 Ice fishing season has started in Pemberton, BC.  It's has been a super long, dry and hot Summer this year and finally we have received some cold temperatures.  Along with the welcomed arrival of Ice we have also received a higher than normal amount of snow fall in the mountains.  This definitely adds to the Winter scenery and gives you the feeling of being in a winter wonderland.  Being that it is just the beginning of the Ice fishing season, one must always test the ice prior to fishing.  It is always a good practice to drill holes as you walk until you become familiar with the lake.  The lake that we are fishing in both the pictures and video has 4" of Ice and will continue to thicken as the season progresses.  Ice fishing Pemberton, British Columbia  Early season Ice fishing can hold some of the best Ice fishing of the year, Fish are eager to bit and are very active.  This day while Ice fishing the temperature was a brisk -4°c.  This is a great temperature for ice fishing because It's just cold enough that you can see your breath and it forms ice quickly.  I was battling to keep my ice hole clear of newly formed ice and keeping my bait thawed was challenging.  Today I tried a few different jigs and had most of my success with the fish talk Zapper.  The Zapper is by far one of the most deadliest Ice fishing lures that money can buy.  When tipped with a shrimp there isn't a fish in any lake that will swim by it.  The Zapper's erratic jigging motion and proven fish catching colors attract fish from far.  Below is a picture of the Zapper.  The Zapper can only be purchased at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd at 1380 Birch street in downtown Pemberton, BC. When it comes to Ice fishing in Pemberton, BC one name stands out, the Pemberton Fish Finder.  The Pemberton Fish Finder offers fishing charters in Pemberton year round. During the Winter months they can be seen visiting the frozen lakes surrounding Whistler and Pemberton daily.  When you fish everyday, you become very proficient in catching fish, you know where they sleep, eat and hangout.  You know where every rock, snag and structure is in every lake.  This is what makes ice fishing with us better than fishing with an average Joe.  All I can say is "be ready to catch fish" and don't miss out this Ice fishing season.  Book your Ice fishing tour today in Pemberton with the Pemberton Fish Finder.  Visit our website for rates and contact information. Enjoy the short Ice fishing video and pictures below.

2015 BC Ice Fishing Report Blackwater Lake 2015 BC Ice Fishing Report Blackwater Lake.  Blackwater lake is located 40 Minutes North of Pemberton, BC and is home to plentiful Rainbow Trout that can grow to 25 inches.  Most Rainbow trout in Blackwater lake average in size between 12" - 18" and weight 1 LB - 2 LBS.  Occasionally you will catch Rainbow Trout over 20" but the non stop action makes up for what the fish lack in size.  It is not uncommon to catch 30 - 40 Rainbow Trout a day while Ice fishing in Blackwater Lake.  Blackwater lake is also known for it's incredible Winter scenery, in every direction there are postcard worthy pictures. Ice Fishing Blackwater Lake There is so much structure on Blackwater Lake that include weed beds, downed trees, shoals with drop-offs and deep current lines. Even the most novice angler can find success at Blackwater Lake which also makes it a great lake to bring your kids for a great outdoor experience.  While ice fishing blackwater lake make sure you bring along a fish talk Zapper.  The Zapper is in the mouth of the Rainbow Trout above and is available only at Spud Valley Sporting Goods ltd at 1380 Birch street in downtown Pemberton, BC.  The Zapper when tipped with a shrimp for bait is irresistible to Rainbow trout.  Mix up your jigging speeds and depths to find out what works best for you.  I've found that working water in depths of 10' - 20' will produce multiple fish in a day.  The Zapper is available in 4 proven fish catching colors.  Stop by the shop to top up your Ice fishing supplies.  The boys have a great map on the counter and don't mind sharing successful fishing locations in the area. Ice fishing tours on Blackwater Lake Nothing rounds out your ice fishing day like having some of your fish cooked up on the BBQ hole side.

Steelhead Fishing In British Columbia Canada Wild Steelhead Fishing in BC, Canada. This video was filmed in Lillooet, BC on the Fraser River, January 29/ 2012 and January 30/2012. The first day I fished for Approximately 1 hour, caught 2 Steelhead and 1 Bull trout. The Second Day I caught 1 Steelhead and a massive Bull trout which I Iost at my feet about 12lbs. I wasn't able to fish as hard as I wanted to because my Wife and child were with me. One word of advice would be to bring lots of Gear with you because the bottom is not lure friendly. Stop By Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd on your way through to gear up. We have a Vast selection of Gear at a Great price, Our 3/4oz crocodile spoons are priced at $3.99 http://store.spudvalley.com/products....

Pemberton & Whistler BC Fishing Reports April 2016 Pemberton & Whistler BC Fishing Reports April 2016.  The huge Coastal Cutthroat Trout above was caught Monday April 4th, 2016 while fly fishing the Birkenhead River.  This massive Cutthroat fell victim to a new fly called the "Montana Mayhem".  This streamer pattern was developed by Scott Leboldus and you can see the recipe on Friday Night Flies @ http://fridaynightflies.com/ If you were thinking of visiting the Pemberton/Whistler area for fishing, this is a great time of the year to do so.  Most of the streams and Rivers in the area have been fishing well.  During the past week of warmer than average temperatures we saw some pre-freshet run off.  Recently the temperatures have started to fall back into a typical range for this time of year.  This has brought the water levels and clarity back for favorable fishing.  Rivers that have been producing are as follows; Ryan River, Birkenhead River and The Green River.  The Upper Lillooet  prior to the warm weather was fishing incredible.  With the warmer than usual weather, the Upper Lillooet River has become silty.  A couple days of cooler weather will have it fishing great again. The Local lakes in Whistler and Pemberton, BC are now free of Ice and have been fishing exceptionally well.  So, If you're thinking of visiting Pemberton or Whistler make sure to bring your lake fishing gear along with ya.  A few lakes worth checking out in Whistler and Pemberton, BC during April are as follows; Alta Lake, Green Lake, Mosquito Lake, Anderson Lake, Ivey Lake and one of my favorites is Lost Lake.  Lost lake this year has been producing some decent Rainbow Trout between 12" - 20" and can weigh as much as 2.5 LBS.  Lost lake is easily fly fished with small nymphs and wooly buggers.  The lake also has numerous docks and being that the water is still very cold, you will not be fighting over dock space with recreational swimmers and sight sightseers. We have included a short fishing video that shows you what you will typically catch in Pemberton and Whistler this time of year.  This time of year being April.  In the Streams and Rivers around Whistler and Pemberton expect to catch Coastal Cutthroat Trout, Rainbow Trout, Bull Trout, Dolly Varden and Whitefish.  In the smaller lakes expect to catch; Rainbow Trout and Cutthroat Trout.  In the larger lakes expect to catch; Coastal Cutthroat Trout, Rainbow Trout, Bull Trout, Dolly Varden, Whitefish and Kokanee.

Fishing Kootenay Lake in British Columbia Pemberton Fish Finder had never fished Kootenay Lake in British Columbia prior to this video.  It took us a few hours to locate the fish and to find out what to use.  Once we got it figured out it was non stop action.  There are a lot of Huge Gerrard Rainbow Trout in Kootenay Lake and they are well protected by the use of barbless hooks.  I lost track of how many trophy fish we lost due to barbless hooks, around 35 and that is no exaggeration.  The house boat is a great way to get to know this lake because it is over 100kms long.  We made camp on the beach and carried on our way the next day.  This fishing trip was one of the most enjoyable adventures I have ever been on.  This boat was 42' long.

Fishing BC Fishing in Beautiful British Columbia is Fantastic with the Pemberton Fish Finder.   Set deep within the coastal Mountains of BC you will find a Village Called Pemberton.  This Village is home to many Glaciers and snow covered mountain tops.  In the summer the snow melts off the mountains and feeds our lakes.  Some of our lake have a bit of a greenish tinge because of glacial till, but most of our lakes are gin clear.  All of our lakes are full of aquatic life so our fish grow rapidly, making it not uncommon to catch trout upwards of 5lbs every tour.  check us out on line http://pembertonfishfinder.com ['where to fish in bc', 'best fishing in bc', 'how to catch fish in bc', 'trolling', 'british columbia', 'fishing report', 'pemberton fish finder', 'brad knowles', 'huge', 'fun fly canada']

Coho Salmon and Chum Salmon Fly Fishing in Squamish BC Canada Coho Salmon and Chum Salmon Fly Fishing in Squamish BC Canada.  Right now the Chum Salmon and Coho Salmon fishing in Squamish is Fantastic!  In the past couple of days the Squamish River, Cheakamus River and the Mamquam River have been receiving waves of beautiful Chrome Chum and Coho Salmon.  Unlike the Pink Salmon fishery, the banks are not lined elbow to elbow with eager fishermen.  The weather is brisk in the morning and warms to the mid teens, which is perfect Salmon fishing temperatures.  The water is very cold so make sure you put on your long underwear under your waders.  The Chum Salmon season is fairly short and peaks by mid November, while the Coho Salmon will be in the Rivers till late December.  Coho Salmon and Chum Salmon fly fishing patterns are similar in design and are fished both with a swinging motion.  Typically there are more Chum Salmon in the Rivers surrounding Squamish.  Periodically, you will be pleasantly surprised when you hook up on a Coho Salmon using the same flies used for Chum Salmon fly fishing.  Although Coho Salmon are not nearly as large, Coho Salmon can reach a staggering 20 LBS in the Rivers surrounding Squamish.  Below is a picture of a couple fly fishing patterns that have been working for both Coho and Chum Salmon in the Squamish River. We have found in the past couple of days that a sleek bodied fly with either orange or green highlights have been working best.  We have been using a type 3 sink tip fly line, tipped with a leader 6' - 8' in length with a breaking strength of 15 LBS on an 8 weight fly rod.  Some people might suggest the use of a leader strength of 20 LBS, this being said 20 LBS leaders will have the capability of breaking an 8 weight fly rod if you are not careful when the Salmon are at your feet.  Simply swinging one of these fly patterns until your line straitens down stream, then a long slow retrieve will produce both Chum Salmon and Coho Salmon.  Chum Salmon takes are typically subtle, while Coho Salmon bites are typically earth shattering.  You will know what I am talking about when it happens.  Once hooked both Salmon put on an aerial display and make large reel screaming runs.   Below are a few pictures of Chum Salmon caught on the Squamish River October 26th, 2015 while fly fishing with the Pemberton Fish Finder.  We have also included a short Salmon fishing video of our day of the Squamish River.  Right now is the time to book your Chum Salmon and Coho Salmon fly fishing trip of a Lifetime with the Pemberton Fish Finder.  Call today toll free 1(877)905-8121 Don't miss out on this spectacular Fly Fishing experience.  Limited Space available!

WTF? Mountsberg Reservoir Conservation Area, Halton, Ontario 1:56 Caught a pike :)  I went to checkout this place for shore fishing opportunities and it's very limited. There's a long shoreline with train tracks but it's illegal to walk along there and also dangerous. You can get fined by the park ranger. I only explored half the lake and I found only 6 spots you can fish from shore. I confirmed that there are bass and pike in here. There's a small lookout dock where I almost caught a bass by twitching the senko underneath the dock. The family that was fishing there caught a lot of bluegills and cat fish.  I do not recommend fishing here but it's a great place to bring family as there are kid-friendly activities there such as a mini farm and nice playgrounds.

I only stayed for 30 minutes and I decided to check out Mountsberg Conservation after.   This will give you a better idea of how the area looks like if you plan on visiting/fishing here.

Sturgeon vs Stella Shore fishing for Sturgeon along the lower Fraser river. Just ten minutes from Vancouver. I'm using my Stella reel, although a reel of this calibre is absolutely not required, it does offer some piece of mind. Sturgeon have been strictly catch and release for the last eight to ten years. This means that each year they are getting bigger and BIGGER! I always want to be prepared. This year alone I've beat my PB three times. Tough rods and tough line are mandatory. Big reels with dependable, strong drags are also keys to success. Remember, no barbs and always match the hatch.

Shoreline Early Spring Lake Trout (Steelhead) - How to Catch Trout from Shore Hello folks! Today we are at the ice-covered shoreline, baited up with Salmon roe bags and the soon-to-be-released Thunder Braid fishing line.  We're fishing at dusk at that last hour or so before the sun completely sets, ready to catch that final steelhead trout bite.  With proper baits we managed to land two nice steelhead trout in the short hours before dark.  Thanks for watching and until next time, good luck and good fishin'!

How to catch Rainbow Trout with Spoon Thanks to my 5000+ subscribers for helping me out with this Channel. If you haven't done so yet, Please Subscribe!   How to Catch Rainbow Trout With Thomas Buoyant Cyclone Spoon. This was my first time fishing East Pit Lake in Alberta Canada north of Wabamun Lake.  This lake was created from an old coal mining pit.  It is deep, long and narrow with foot access only.  This lake has legends of holding 10 pound rainbow trout but with increased pressure you're probably more likely to get some 18-20 inch fish as the big ones these days.  I started out fishing with a spoon as the lure is heavier and even though small allows you to get it a fair distance into the lake from shore.  In a few casts I was hooked up with the first 16 inch rainbow trout.  Watch and I catch a bunch of hook ups, amazing runs and jumps from these scrappy Alberta Pothole Lake Rainbow Trout.  Through the video I'll help you get started catching Rainbow Trout on Spoons with a few tips that always seem to help me catch more fish when I'm out on the water.  Hope you enjoy and don't forget to subscribe.

Boatless Angler - Shore Fishing for Bullhead with Worms (Easy Catfish Rig) We're boatless today, fishing on the shore lines with the boatless angler himself, rigged up with an easy pre-tied catfish rig.  It's early spring, which is a great opportunity for the boatless angler to get out and get into some great fishing. Today we're fishing for those bullhead catfish, using worms and the easy T-Turn pre-tied catfish rig.  If you're interested in getting your own easy pre-tied catfish rig, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/product.php?productid=379&cat=71&page=1  For worms, we're using leaf worms which I got from my compost bin in the backyard.  The water is still cold today, so the bites are a bit 'slower'. But with the colder water, it forces the fish nice and close to the shoreline, which is holding the slightly warmer water. Perfect for your boatless angler.

Circle Hooks and Bolt Rigs to Catch Common Carp from the Shoreline Hello folks. We're back on the shorelines this lovely summer day as we're rigged and baited up to catch common carp.  We're set up with a t-turn swivel rig, complete with a very heavy 4oz sinker, and a circle hook loaded up with natural canned corn. With this bolt-rig, we cast out into the water and patiently wait.  A very important note: when using a bolt rig to catch carp, keep your drag loose while waiting for the bite. This will prevent the carp from bolting away and taking your fishing rod with it!

Leduc Reservoir Rainbow Trout Fishing Challenge I never fished Leduc Reservoir before but always knew they stocked it every spring with rainbow trout.  Over the years I have heard that some may overwinter and get to large sizes.  I also read that this lake is notorious for sending anglers home with the SKUNK rather than a nice fat rainbow trout.  So I made it my personal challenge to go there and catch some of those fat fish.  I was determined not to take the skunk home with me.  Since the reservoir is only 10 minutes from my In-laws farm it makes a quick outing.  So I headed out early one frosty morning and launch my boat.  I trolled and casted every lure known to man all over that piece of water for no bites.  So around 2 pm I landed right where I launched and started to fish.  Turns out that is where all the hungry fish were and I hooked up on seven but only got one on shore.  Took him home for dinner and called it a day.  Hope these tips can also help you catch some of those fish on the reservoir.

Shore Fishing with the LIVETARGET Goby II It could have been an ICAST award winner and is, in my experience, one of the best -if not THE BEST- producing baits I've ever helped develop.  It's already proven itself to me in Cyprus Lake, Lake Erie and Balsam Lake but did you know that it is so good that you can catch a pike off a snag from shore with it? I caught another one afterward, not far from the first one, by dead sticking the goby near bottom.

Creek Mouth Fishing in BC Creek mouth fishing in British Columbia can be very fun when using the Fraser River Rainbow Plug.  The Fraser River Rainbow Plug cast very well even in windy conditions.  When you use the Fraser River Rainbow you will notice its life like action, it promotes strikes from large fish.  Fishing this lake in the video we caught every species in the lake with this plug except for kokanne, but we have caught them there before with it.

Birkenhead Lake best fishing in British Columbia Canada Birkenhead Lake best fishing in British Columbia Canada.  The gate to Birkenhead Lake provincial park is now open for the season.  The park operators are busy cleaning the park, removing fallen trees and clearing debris from the trails.  They should have the park open for the May long weekend.  As of now the overflow campground is open for people to camp.  Birkenhead lake is known for producing very large Bull Trout.  Although Bull Trout are catch and release in Birkenhead Lake you can still fish for them.  Always handle them with the upmost care and return them to the lake in a speedily fashion to reduce damaging impacts.  The lake also has a healthy population of Rainbow Trout and Kokanee.  Kokanee are a staple food for these trophy sized Bull Trout.  This being said imitate the size and color of the Kokanee and this will produce large fish in Birkenhead Lake.  Fishing Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park  There are numerous good locations to fish Birkenhead Lake from shore.  Two of my favorite spots are at the mouths of Phelix Creek and Sockeye Creek.  Phelix Creek is located at the North end of the lake and is a short walk from the picnic area.  Sockeye Creek is a 35 Minute walk up the West side of Birkenhead Lake.  Both of these areas listed will produce Trophy sized Bull Trout, Rainbow Trout and Kokanee.  I have witnessed numerous quality fish caught right off of the dock at Birkenhead lake provincial park.  The lake also has a paved boat launch suitable for boats up to 18' in length.  Hiking in Birkenhead Lake Provincial Park  Wilderness Trail:  A 2-kilometre hiking trail through old growth forest leads to a flat, treed area with views of the mountains across the lake and views back of the day use area beaches. A short section connects with the Birkenhead Lake Trail, allowing for a longer hike or a loop back to the trailhead.  Caution Note: The lakeside Wilderness Trail and the Birkenhead Lake Trail: approximately 1.0 km from the trail head at the parking lot, both of these trails cross a 50 metre section of a rock debris avalanche path. Trail users must use caution when crossing over loose rock rubble and may be required to ford the stream. Crossings should be avoided during periods of prolonged, heavy rain.  Birkenhead Lake Trail:  The 8-kilometre trail to Birkenhead Lake Estates at the south end of the lake joins up with Birkenhead Road and Tenas Valley logging road. This trail is used by both hikers and cyclists. There may also be horseback riding on the west half of the Birkenhead Lake trail up to Sockeye Creek. Motorized vehicles are not permitted on this trail.  Goat Lookout Trail:  This 1-kilometre trail on the south side of the valley is a bit rough and steep in places, but offers a view of the lake at it’s end and in the spring and fall mountain goats may be seen on the cliffs above the campground.  Cautionary Note: During the spring snow melt (April - June), Phelix Creek water levels rise and may crest the log bridge approximately 100 metres from the start of the trail. High water conditions may require temporary seasonal closure of the trail. Best you otherwise hike the trail in the mornings during May and June.

How to locate fish on different bodies of water and find suitable locations to place your fly.  Target areas with high fish concentrations and you'll be into fish after fish this fall with these tips I've learned fishing on the pond.  Float fishing can be very effective when water temperature is still warm and oxygen concentrations are low or focused in a certain area.  Using a catatonic leech will help you hold the lure in that target zone increasing your odds of hooking up.  Give it a try this fall and enjoy some great fishing.  Bobbers Down - Fish On!

Float Fishing for Salmon in New York Float Fishing for king salmon in the Oswego River, NY. After catching some salmon at night on lures, we switched over to skein and floats when the sun started to hit the river. The fishing was steady and the kings plentiful despite less than ideal river conditions. For myself, watching a float bounce 4-5 times and then diving is such a beautiful sight when fishing for salmon. The snaggers did not fair nearly as well....when will they learn that trying to catch them is easier than snagging?

Lake fishing for stocked trout Even though its the middle of the summer, all the trout in the lakes, creeks and ponds, aren't gone. You just need to find the right places. This lake that I was fishing was over 100 feet in depth. We were finding the trout in a cove at about 30' of water. We were using a typical slip bobber rig and a size 10 hook with a worm or minnow on the bottom. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Check us out on instagram: @coop_2528 @the_master_caster @the_master_casters --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Enjoy our video and remember to like and to leave any questions or comments in the section below!

Port Renfrew halibut & salmon fishing: A Vicious Day in April An early season fishing day with Des Hatchard of Vicious Fish Charters.  We caught a couple of halibut quite quickly, didn't have to go far this morning.  The fish were about 25 and 60 pounds -- the big guy put up a bit of a fight, racing down to the bottom a couple of times.   Afterwards, we pulled anchor and caught a couple of small feeder chinook salmon on the way home (winter springs), and then came back to a full crab trap.  A fun time was had, looking forward to a summer of Vancouver Island fishing adventures.

Salt Water Fishing Tours - Glacier Bay Country Inn - Gustavus Alaska Glacier Bay and Icy Strait possess all the best attributes of saltwater big-game fishing, without any of the shortcomings.  Consider the facts as to why our sport fisheries are second to none.  Because we primarily fish inside waters, travel time to blue-ribbon fishing grounds takes less than 40 minutes. Because there are no ocean swells where we fish, seasickness is rare.  The waters we fish are also protected from severe storms, which allow fishing when other areas are blown out.  Each summer, humpback whales migrate to our waters from as far away as Hawaii to feed and fatten up on an abundance of bait fish and herring. The abundance of feed also attracts bottom fish, like Alaska Halibut.  We catch huge halibut here as opposed to what they catch in other parts of Alaska. We have often said the next world record would come from here and this summer what would have been a world record had it been handled correctly was caught here. A 482 lb monster.  Veteran saltwater anglers fish with us each year because of the sheer number and variety of sport fish we have.  Fishing at this Alaska fishing lodge is also ideal for spouses or non-anglers who want to indulge in Alaska sport fishing for the first time. We’re also the destination of choice for the angler or non-angler who wants to take home a sampling of fresh Alaska seafood to share with family and friends.

Walleye Northern Pike and Perch Ice Fishing Makwa Lake Ice Fishing Saskatchewan was a tough go for us, the weather was hot them freezing cold.  The fish were in a super negative mood.  We drilled many holes and found some fish willing to cooperate.  The locals told us the fish weren't biting and all they were getting were small ones.  So we felt pretty good to scrape up a few nice fish.  The slender spoon and MarCum were essential in getting us on the fish and somehow convincing them to bite.

Fish Inn Ice Shelter - Lake Couchiching Quick go-round of our ice fishing pop-up the Fish Inn Ice Getaway (by Equinox), and a view of the (obviously!) frozen Lake Couchiching in Orillia, where we were ice fishing for some jumbo perch.  It is supposed to be a four to six person hub shelter, and four of us were set up inside with our gear and camping chairs.  Six would be tight  (or impossible) with camping chairs, but if we were using bucket seats, and kept some stuff outside, it could be done. Plenty of room to move around, and best of all, plenty of room to stand up in - 82" high!!!.   Lots of windows (6), and 2 doors on opposite ends.  A generous skirt around the perimeter for snow cover to keep the wind out and the shelter down!   Hopefully I get a chance to get out again before the season ends, and do a video of setting up and taking down.  Set-up is a snap, and not including anchoring, I can probably get it out of the bag, and up in less than a minute!

Fly Fishing Egg Patterns In British Columbia Fishing egg patterns this time of year can be very effective.  When the Salmon move into the rivers to spawn they leave behind some taste treats for the trout.  In fast moving streams "Birkenhead River" use a strike indicator, this will increase your odds and also give you better control of your single egg patterns.  You will miss less fish.

Coastal Cutthroat Trout Fly Fishing in British Columbia Coastal Cutthroat Trout Fly Fishing in British Columbia.  This is a very exciting time of year for the Pemberton Fish Finder.  With the arrival of Spring we welcome with open arms the Coastal Cutthroat Fly fishing season.  Why are we so excited?  Because these feisty sea run trout are like Steelhead, minus the size and Pemberton, British Columbia has some of the Best fly fishing for Coastal Cutthroat Trout in the World.  While the season is just getting started, we recommend that clients book now.  The Coastal Cutthroat fishing season is relatively short.  It starts typically mid March and wraps up by the end of May.  Cutthroat in the Pemberton, BC area range in size from 12" - 26" and can weigh as much as 6.5 LBS.  Pound for pound Coastal Cutthroat Trout are one of the hardest fighting fish in the World.  They are ferocious feeders that travel in large schools of fish.  Simply put, swing your fly in their vicinity and they will let you know that they are there.  Boom! There are multiple Rivers in the Pemberton area that Coastal Cutthroat Trout can be caught.  Rivers that include; Lillooet River, Ryan River, Green River and the Birkenhead River.  These Rivers mentioned are the larger of the Rivers in the Pemberton area.  There are many other streams in Pemberton that hold great opportunities of catching these sought after Trout.  Coastal Cutthroat Trout typically hold in deep, slow moving water that has a decent food source.  They feed heavily on Salmon fry, stonefly nymphs and case caddis. Fly fishing for Cutthroat can be very easy at times when you have the right equipment.  Start off with a 5 -6wt fly rod, type 3 sink tip and use 8' - 9' of 6 LB tippet.  The fly above is called the Motto Minnow.  It replicates a Salmon fry perfectly.  These flies are available at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd. at 1380 Birch street in downtown Pemberton, BC.  One thing I will add is that if you catch 1 Cutthroat, there will be more there.  Cutthroat never travel alone, It might be a short bus but there will be other passengers. Fly fishing is our passion, we enjoy sharing our vast knowledge with our clients in an entertaining way that is safe, fun, educational and rewarding.  That's a lot to put into one sentence.   When I talk about our fly fishing guides, I explain to people that the tug is their drug.  No matter how steep the hill or how long the walk, no fish is safe.  When our fly fishing guides get a seldom day off, what do they do?  They go fishing, testing new patterns, finding new fishing locations and always learning.  Fly Fishing is a way of life for the guides at Pemberton Fish Finder.  Join us on a fly fishing tour and get on the fast track to success! Below is a few Pictures of Coastal Cutthroat Trout that were caught March 1st, 2016 with the Pemberton Fish Finder. We have also put a short fly fishing video together for your enjoyment.

Monster Lingcod Jig Fishing Gibbs Delta Tackle Fishing for Monster Lingcod and hooked up with a dandy on a Delta Tackle Scampi Tail Glow Jig.  We were baiting our hooks with some fish skin which is super tough, stays on like a charm and lasts for hours.  Hauling up these huge, great tasting fish is one of the joys of fishing off of Vancouver Island here in British Columbia.   It is amazing that you can drive to a fishing destination like this.

Chum Salmon Fly Patterns and Guided fly fishing tours Chum Salmon Fly Patterns and Guided fly fishing tours.  At the Pemberton Fish Finder we are always looking for that "Fly" that separates us from our competition.  You will also notice that we do not shy away from sharing useful fishing information.  We love it when people have a Great day on the River or Lake, for this is what fishing is all about.   We understand that fishing is about getting outdoors and having a good time as one with nature, but at the end of the day It's all about catching fish.  The fly we are about to share with you in the video and pictures below was designed by Brad Knowles of the Pemberton Fish Finder.  This fly has only been tested in the Rivers surrounding Squamish with huge success.  It was designed to catch both Coho Salmon and Chum Salmon, let's just say it works Great.  The SSG Bucktail fly is a simple pattern to fly fish.  Simply swing this fly using an 8 weight fly rod with a type 3 sinking tip fly line.  Add a 6' - 9' leader of 15 LB test and once the swing straitens out, retrieve with a long slow strip.  Follow this simple procedure and it will produce Salmon after Salmon.  If you would like to tie the SSG Bucktail, we have the complete tie available with a material list on YouTube.

WTF? Holland River, Bradford, Ontario I went to check out the crappie fishing in May and the day I went, the crappie were hot. I caught about 20 crappies within 1 hour. I didn't buy a gopro camera at that time but I'll be back next year to record the fishing experience.   As you can see, there are tons of fishermen from both side of the canal. I wouldn't recommend eating fish from this canal because of all the pollutants from the farmland.

Fun Coho Salmon fishing near Whistler BC Canada Fun Coho Salmon fishing near Whistler BC Canada.  It's that time of year that both Northern Coho Salmon and your typical Coho Salmon start flooding the Streams and Rivers surrounding Whistler, BC.  You might ask what the difference between Coho's are and the Answer is simple.  Northern Coho Salmon can reach a staggering 25 LBS, while regular Coho hover between 6 LBS - 10 Lbs.  These Coho also have a very distinctive jaw curl, as shown in the picture above.  You don't want to get you fingers in his mouth!   Both Strains of Coho Salmon visit the Rivers in Squamish, BC and Pemberton, BC.  The two towns listed are approximately a half hour drive either South "Squamish" or North "Pemberton" of Whistler on highway 99. How to Catch Coho Salmon while Fishing. With the recent arrival of Coho Salmon the guides from the Pemberton Fish Finder have been running around doing their homework.  Finding out what works best prior to clients going on a successful fishing adventure is important.  Locating holes, colors, patterns and picking up garbage as we go.  What we have found to be working best right now has been spoons and spinners while spin fishing.  You can't go wrong with spoons and spinners sporting the colors green or blue.  We have found that a slow retrieval speed has been working best, you just want your spoon wobbling and your spinners just spinning.  Keep your gear near the bottom for best results.  While the Coho Salmon numbers increase in the rivers, we will definitely be putting more time in fly fishing.  Remember this is just the start of the Coho Salmon season and there is nothing better than reeling in one of these power horses on a fly rod.  Coho are known to put on crazy aerial displays and it's tough to keep them on a barbless hook , trust me.  Below I have included a picture of the spoons and spinners we have been having most success with.  All of these lures are available at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd in Pemberton, BC at 1380 Birch street.  Our in-house brand cost a fraction of comparable lures.  Come check them out. Coho Salmon fishing guides in British Columbia Canada As you can see above, we don't mind sharing fishing tips.

Winter fly fishing in Squamish British Columbia Canada Winter fly fishing in Squamish British Columbia Canada.  Since the warm rain we have had in the past week the Rivers surrounding Squamish, BC have opened up and are free of ice.  This is a welcomed sight since Squamish holds some fantastic fly fishing opportunities for Steelhead, Rainbow Trout and Bull Trout.  Although today we were targeting Steelhead we had many bycatches in the means of Bull Trout.  Bull Trout are the Largest resident fish in the Squamish River and tributaries.  These fish can grow as large as 15 LBS and have a length in excess of 30", not a bad bycatch if you ask me.  Bull Trout are not know to put on aerial displays, but they are known for long hard runs and violent head shakes.  BC Fly Fishing Tips The Winter Fly Fishing season in Squamish is a great way to spend the day.  Typically the weather in Squamish is mild compared to Whistler's Ice Fishing temperatures that are well below freezing.  Now that the banks are clear of ice, fly fishing can easily be done during walk and wadding sessions.  During the Winter months you want to be using egg patterns and flesh fly patterns while fly fishing. You can see some great examples of flies to use for the Squamish River on Friday Night Flies or come into Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd in Pemberton to fill your fly box before your outing.  These fly patterns work well this time of year because the Coho Salmon have recently finished spawning and the Trout are still swimming around cleaning up after them. Cheakamus River in Squamish This river contains the highest concentration of Bull Trout and a close second is Steelhead.  The Cheakamus River is a favorable River for wading although there is limited access.  For this reason we suggest to pack a lunch and book a fly fishing tour with the Pro's at Pemberton Fish Finder.  The Cheakamus river is home to the only Salmon hatchery in Squamish making it a fool proof area to focus your fly fishing efforts. Mamquam River in Squamish The Mamquam River is the first major tributary to the Squamish River from the ocean.  It is a reasonably short River with great access that makes it a popular fly fishing destination.  Throughout the Winter season look forward to catching Steelhead, Rainbow Trout and Bull Trout while fly fishing.  One of the most popular spots to fly fish on the Mamquam River is where the CN Railway bridge crosses the River.  At this point you can fly fish both upstream and downstream to the mouth where it meets the Squamish River. Squamish River Winter Fly Fishing The upper sections of the Squamish River sees the highest concentration of Steelhead in the Winter months.  This area is best fly fished from mid February - April if you are looking for Steelhead.  The upper sections of the Squamish River are easily accessed by the Squamish River FSR.  The Squamish River FSR follows along side the Squamish River for 20+ KMS.  While fly fishing the upper Squamish River look for large holding waters and never pass up the opportunity to fish the tail outs.  Steelhead also love to sit in the fast waters, so fish it all.  The upper section of the Squamish River is very remote and not fly fished by your average Joe.

Heli Fishing in Whistler British Columbia Canada Heli Fishing in Whistler British Columbia Canada.  Take in the best scenery the World has to offer in a short 30 minute helicopter ride.  Although this was not the lake we intended to fish the fishing was still incredible.  The lake we were wanting to fish our pilot told us it was thawed and upon arrival we found that it was not.  Our group still caught roughly 150 Rainbow Trout averaging 8" - 10".  You could practically catch a Trout on every cast while fly fishing.  A Great way to get someone hooked on Fishing.  The lake we were supposed to be fishing has 2.5 lb Rainbow Trout.  The fishing is equally as good, just the Trout are much larger.  Almost every Alpine lake in the Whistler area is full of Beautiful Virgin Trout that rarely to never see hooks because of there remoteness.  This makes them very easy to catch, they almost throw themselves on to the hook.  Very Exciting! Visit our website for more information about Heli Fishing in Whistler British Columbia Canada. http://pembertonfishfinder.com  Sit back, make some popcorn and enjoy the video! We look forward to fishing with you, Tight lines.   ps.  If you enjoyed the video please give us a like and share.  They take a ton of time to make for everyone's enjoyment.

Everyday is a heli fishing kind of day in British Columbia Fish stories are known for stretching the truth.  Small fish get bigger, Big fish get bigger, and the stories get more epic with each retelling.  Sometimes there's no need for exaggeration, sometimes there's a helicopter.  The difference between a good day and a great day fishing is a scenic flight through the coastal mountains of British Columbia.  Let's not forget about the Trout fishing, these fish rarely see hooks.  This makes them very eager to bite almost anything you tie on the end of your fishing line.  First time fly fishers feel like a pro, simply because you can do no wrong.  Get your friends and family members hooked on fishing on one of the many high paced, remote alpine lakes surrounding Whistler, British Columbia.  There is nothing quite like having a lake to yourself for the day that is absolutely steaming with fish.   We typically wrap up the heli fishing season by the end of October or as snow starts to fly in the alpine.  As the days grow shorter, trout really start to feed frantically in anticipation for the winter months.  I've had Trout take a fly dangling over the side of my float tube while I searched for another pattern that was less worn.  The only reason you will typically change a fly is because it has been worn out by repeated abuse.   There is no need for a substantial fly selection, simply bring a few locator flies such as black spratleys,  pumpkin heads and wooly buggers in a variety of colors.  Dry fly fishing can almost seem like work just keeping your fly riding high.  At almost the second your fly hits the water it will boil with trout activity.  We have found that the larger of trout caught are caught with wet flies. Our small flotation devises are called float tubes.  Float tubes are very comfortable and pack away nice and compact which is important being there is limited space in a helicopter.  These float tubes gain you access to an entire alpine lake, no fish is safe.  It is difficult to take in the endless scenery in every direction and the thousand smells of fresh Alpine air between bites.  At the end of the day or during your lunch, sit back and enjoy a small campfire.  Going home with the smell of success on your hands and the light Aroma of campfire smoke on your clothing is the proof of a Great day.

Ivey Lake Fly Fishing in British Columbia Canada Ivey Lake Fly Fishing in British Columbia Canada.  Ivey lake offers some of the Best Fly Fishing in British Columbia, Canada. After watching the video of Scott and myself fly fishing Ivey Lake for the day, I have realized just how good of friends we are.  The music almost makes it seem like a love story, but that's not the case.  Both Myself and Scott are happily married.  When you are catching fish for fish of this quality, one can get lost in the moment and surroundings.  This day there was a buzz in the air, that was serenaded by the hum of our fly reel drags.  We caught Rainbow Trout after Rainbow Trout, with both dry lines and sinking lines, on troll and on the strip.  It was as if we could do no wrong.  This was not the case for a couple others that visited the lake on the same day as the Fish Finder.  After about the 10th fish, I rowed over to the unfortunate individuals and passed them off a couple flies that were working for us.  Soon they were into fish as well and to me this is what fishing is all about.  It's not about catching every fish in the lake while onlookers wish they could just catch one.  Fishing is about the excitement of catching a fish, that moment you feel a tug on your line, the Fulfillment of anticipation. What should you use on Ivey Lake? For those of you that want to tackle fly fishing on Ivey lake yourselves, 5 words "Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd."  Spud is well equipped with all of your fly fishing needs.  Their staff fish the lake regularly.  Swing by the shop, they'll pick you out a selection of fish catching flies for Ivey Lake and wish you luck.  For those of you that want to be on the fast track to success we recommend booking a fishing tour with us, the Pemberton Fish Finder.  No one knows this lake better than us.

Wabamun Lake Trophy Northern Pike Fishing 2014 Wabamun Lake Northern Pike Fishing Alberta Canada June 2014.  After hearing about the amazing pike fishing and monsters that swim in this water I thought I better just go try it out.  We didn't get out on the water until noon and then we were able to fish till 3 pm when a storm blew in and chased us off the water.  Fishing was great in the shallow water.  Lots of minnows and perch hanging out in the shallows outside the train bridge off the provincial park.  Where the bait are the pike were sure to follow.  Tons of pike around with follows and hits almost every cast.  Even hitting the top water!  Lots of fun out there.  Nothing massive.  Biggest was 36" on a homemade spinner.  A guy fishing off shore said he caught a 15 pound and lost a monster near shore.

How to Catch Cold Lake Walleye Fishing Alberta Cold Lake is one of the few lakes in the province where you can still keep walleye without a tag.  This is not due to the abundance of walleye though, but rather due to fisheries not managing this as a walleye fishery.  They don't seem to care what happens to the population sadly.  So for now you can keep some but they sure are elusive and after fishing a few days for them I finally managed to catch three.  There are much better walleye lakes in the province and if you are just after walleye you probably could spend your time better somewhere else.  Consider trying near by Moose Lake or Marie Lake that are loaded with walleye and where you can also keep one for the dinner table.  If you do go to Cold Lake you will have a lot more fun fishing for the abundant pike and Lake trout that come in very large sizes at this lake.  Hope you enjoy the video.

So pack up your boat and downriggers to go check it out for yourself.  It is a beautiful lake with frequent aerial shows as fighter jets fly in formation over the lake in and out of the air weapons range.  With a fish finder you'll be able to locate the fish and troll at the appropriate depth to catch them.  A variety of lures with help you land a good number of fish.  Some of the best spoons are the Williams Wobbler and Whitefish.  The Luhr Jensen Manistee is also a local favorite.  You can also pull jointed Rapalas and other floating crankbaits.  Bait really isn't needed as these fish are very willing to hit a lure.  Trolling speed should be varied from 1.5 mph to 3 mph for best results.

Gull Lake Alberta Ice Fishing Whitefish Perch Pike and Walleye This was our first time fishing Gull Lake and this is how we got it done on a bright sunny high pressure cold front when few other people were catching fish.  You can tell from the constant buzz of Augers in the background that people were moving around a lot rather than catching fish.   We had a slow day but managed several nice fish out in deeper water.  All on the small slender spoon.  We caught several perch, a nice whitefish, a walleye and a few pike.  It really is amazing how many people fish this lake on a week day!  Simply amazing.  Check it out and I hope you enjoy the show.  Lots of room out there and I feel like despite the pressure there are still a lot of fish to be caught.

Cold Lake Alberta Lake Trout Fishing Underwater Video with Luhr Jensen J Plug, Coyote Spoon and Manistee Spoon.  GoPro Hero and my home built underwater housing once again helped capture some very interesting footage.  See exactly how the lake trout come in to inspect a lure and how quick they are to decide its something they'd rather not put their mouth on.  To tell you the truth I think these guys were camera shy and if this line was run correctly about 20 feet off the wire the fish would have probably been more likely to commit.  It is fun to see how they react so I'll keep dragging the underwater camera around and see what happens in the future.  I really wasn't trying to put Luhr Jensen on the spot I just realized it after when I was editing that I had chose three different Luhr Jensen lures to put behind the camera.   The second rod we were running a Williams Whitefish and was doing very well catching fish.

Slender Spoon Walleye Fishing Tips I know you have seen me use Slender Spoons a lot and quite simply that's because they work very well.  So we'll that I often wasn't worried about losing several fish during the day due to the poor quality treble hook they come with.  In this video I finally switched out the treble hook and it made a slow day great because my hook up rate went way up and I was landing nearly every fish.  So if you notice you're losing fish while using a slender spoon change out the treble.

Showh Lakes in Whistler a hidden fly fishing gem Showh Lakes in Whistler a hidden fly fishing gem.  Showh lakes is accessed via 16 mile creek forest service road.  The road itself is rough and the use of a 4 x 4 is recommended.  Although in the video and pictures that we took in the short period that we visited Showh lakes does not represent the lake well.  There are Cutthroat Trout that reach 20"s in length and we saw numerous Trout between 14" - 16".  While visiting Showh lakes my cell phone was going in and out of service, which is hard on batteries.  Once We hooked a larger Cutthroat, I planned on taking a picture only to find out that my battery was dead.  Needless to say, Showh Lakes is loaded with fish and a must visit if you like dry fly fishing in Whistler, BC.  We only fly fished the first of the two Showh lakes.  Supposedly the second lake has much larger fish, but I have yet to fish it.  After the first Showh Lake the forest service road deteriorates rapidly.  Watch out for ATV riders on the forest service road because one of the Whistler activity companies takes there ATV tours up there. Fly fishing Showh Lakes Showh lakes is a hidden Dry Fly fishing Gem.  It had been nearly 20 years since I last fly fished Showh lakes, so I did a slow lap of the lake to get orientated with the lake.  Marking structure and always looking for anything that the Trout were feeding on.  On my tour of the lake I noticed that the Cutthroat Trout were feeding on very small midge and small caddis.  Bingo!  There is one fly that imitates these flies to a tee, the Adams.  The Adams is a traditional dry fly primarily used for trout. It is considered a general imitation of an adult mayfly, flying caddis or midge.  We were running Adams on a size 14 and 16 hook.  Be prepared to catch lots of fish and have the sweet smell of success on your hands. We have attached a short fly fishing video of Showh Lakes in Whistler, BC Enjoy!

Winter fly fishing in Squamish BC Canada Winter fly fishing in Squamish BC Canada.  The temperature during the Winter months in Squamish is typically favorable for fly fishing.  As long as the river has not seen sub zero temperature for more than a few days the Rivers should be free of ice.  Use caution when the shorelines are icy, we always recommend the use of studded wading boots during the Winter months on any stream.  The Rivers surrounding Squamish see a decent Steelhead run throughout the Winter months.  The resident Rainbow Trout and Bull Trout fishing holds strong as they clean up the remanence of the salmon runs.  The use of flesh and egg patterns will continue to work well throughout the months of December.  January most persons fly fishing switch over to intruder style flies as the Steelhead season starts to pick up.  Squamish offers great Winter fly fishing for both beginner and advanced fly fishers.  It is not uncommon to land numerous fish in the course of a day fishing the Rivers surrounding Squamish.  Resident Trout can grow in excess of 6 LBS and Steelhead can grow in excess of 20 LBS.  The following fly fishing video was filmed on the Cheakamus River in Squamish, BC.  Other notable Rivers to fly fish in Squamish during the Winter months include the Squamish River and the Mamquam River.  The Rivers surrounding Squamish do not receive a lot of fishing pressure throughout the Winter month.  The Squamish Rivers offers some of the best winter fly fishing in British Columbia.   If you would like to get out and learn how to fly fish the rivers surrounding Squamish, we offer both full day and half day fly fishing trips in Squamish.

The Sea to Sky corridor includes; Whistler, Squamish and Pemberton British Columbia.  Mr. Banks asked "Is this a typical day?" My response was Yes, then I went into depth.  With over 50 bodies of water to choose from, 5 Pacific Salmon to choose from and over 10 Species of fish to catch, there is never a Dull day.  Than add some of the most scenic scenery in the World and ball that up, lets just say you are going to want to bring your camera along.

Winter fly fishing in Pemberton BC Canada Winter fly fishing in Pemberton BC Canada.  Our Winter fly fishing trips are weather permitting.  The Coho Salmon are just finishing up their spawn.  They have left  behind lots of tasty treats in the form of eggs.  Egg can be easily simulated with the use of an egg pattern and a good presentation.  Large streamers and flesh patterns can also work well this time of year.  As the water drops with the temperature falling, the river banks become exposed and travel is a breeze.  Some of the smaller tributaries can pose casting restrains due to their dense brush cover, but if there is a will, there is a way. On this day we are fly fishing the Upper Lillooet river and one of its many tributaries.  The fly fishing is very good this time of year and there is zero to no pressure.  You can expect to have the river to yourself.  Give the boys at Spud Valley Sporting Goods a call (604)894-6630 for river conditions.  If the weather gets a cold snap, call to make sure the rivers haven't froze over.  If you are looking to book a fly fishing trip give our booking agent a call toll free 1(877)905-8121 or email info@pembertonfishfinder.com .  Melissa will advise you as to availability and fishing options.

Multiple Day Freshwater Fishing Trips in British Columbia Canada Multiple Day Freshwater Fishing Trips in British Columbia Canada.  First of all, it truly was a toss up which picture of Pete's was going to be in the header.  On both days Pete caught trophy status Trout.  On the First day Pete joined our fishing guide Scott on a full day fly fishing tour.  During the day Pete got to fly fish 2 of our lovely streams in Pemberton, BC.  He capped the day off landing a huge Coastal Cutthroat Trout while fly fishing.  Pete would be first to admit that these Cutthroat are pound for pound one of the hardest fighting fish in the World.  Throughout the course of the day the boys landed numerous Trout, shared stories and plenty of high fives.  Pete, being from New York was a bit overwhelmed by the pure beauty of the surroundings and the quality of fishing.  Fishing is a Fun Things to do in Whistler, BC.  During the Second day Pete joined Brad Knowles on a fishing adventure to one of the many lakes surrounding Pemberton, BC.  We only had a half day to work with so Brad kept Pete focused on the prize.  The prize being the possibility of catching a Bull Trout weighing in with a mass of over 20 LBS.  Bull Trout are known to be ferocious feeders and tops of any food chain when it comes to fish in a Lake.  When flies or lures are presented in a manner they find desirable, it's almost like work reeling them in.  After a short period of getting Pete dialed in I heard a short grunt come from his mouth.  I turned to see his rod doubled and the pure look of excitement on his face.  The battle took nearly 20 minutes and ended with a great picture and a huge Bull Trout being released back to the lake to live another day.  Let's just say Pete will be joining us again next year.  Below we have added a few pictures and a video of Pete's massive Bull Trout.

Best Brook Trout Ice Fishing in British Columbia Canada Best Brook Trout Ice Fishing in British Columbia Canada.  Brook Trout are very aggressive feeders in the Winter months.  The water is very shallow where we are Ice fishing so you can watch the fish take your lure.  The Brook Trout in this lake average between 14" - 21" and can weigh as much as 5 Lbs.  Ice fishing this day we caught over 100 Brook trout.  We found that a short fast jigging motion was getting them.  It really didn't matter what we were using but we found that the Zapper was working best.  The Zapper is available at Spud Valley Sporting goods ltd in Pemberton at 1380 Birch Street.  If you have never experienced Brook Trout fishing you must.  Book an Ice fishing tour of a lifetime today with the Pemberton Fish Finder.  Visit our website for more information and rates.

Chris Fraser purchased this tour, it was only suppost to be for 2 people but when the tour is helping people in our Community I figured I would let him fill the truck.  I am glad I did because we had a fantastic day.  The weather was great and the fish were biting, what else could you ask for!  I would like to thank Chris Fraser for purchasing this Tour and helping Nick in his time of Need.  I can't wait to see your new house Nick!

Ice fishing  Duffey Lake in British Columbia Ice fishing  Duffey Lake in British Columbia.  Duffey Lake is located on highway 99 approximately 40 Minutes North of Pemberton, BC.  Nestled in the Scenic Coastal Mountains of BC, this lake holds incredible Ice fishing for Rainbow Trout.  Rainbow Trout in Duffey Lake are typically small ranging in size from 10" - 14".  On occasion Trout will break 16 inches in length.  Although Rainbow Trout in Duffey lake are not huge, beautiful scenery and non stop action will make up for what they lack in size.  Duffey lake has great access via Highway 99.  The road follows the entire southern shoreline.  In the video and pictures we are fishing at the Eastern end of the lake also known as the Lillooet, BC end of the Duffey Lake. When it comes to Ice fishing or fishing Duffey lake, it does not seem to matter what you are using.  Rainbow Trout seem to be eager to bite nearly anything tipped with bait.  This day myself and Sheridan Knowles of the Pemberton Fish Finder were using Northland tackle's Fireball jig and the famous Fish Talk Zapper.  Both of these jigs were tipped with salad shrimp from the Pemberton Valley Supermarket, located in downtown Pemberton.  We fished a few different depths and found that fish were more actively feeding mid to bottom.  Simply jig in series of 3 - 4 then let sit for 5 - 10 seconds.  We found that Trout in Duffey lake were hitting more while the jigs were sitting motionless.  The jigging motion seemed to attract them from a distance and once they caught the baits scent, they could not resist putting it in their mouth.  Fish On! Duffey Lake is a great lake to introduce Kids and families to Ice fishing.  It is a high paced, high catch lake that is set in some of the most jaw dropping  scenery that British Columbia has to offer.  Duffey Lake has minimal human impact and zero pollution which makes it a Great lake to take your fish home to eat.  You will notice the difference between store bought fish and fish that come from this crisp, clean, sub alpine lake immediately.  If you are needing more help with gear selection or popular fishing spots on Duffey Lake, stop by Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd.  At 1380 Birch street in Downtown Pemberton, BC.  Spud is well equipped with all your ice fishing needs.  If they don't have it, you don't need it! Below is a short Video of Ice fishing Duffey Lake.  The Pemberton Fish Finder does not offer Ice fishing tours on this lake because it is in a Provincial park and a park use permit is needed to guide this lake.  The general public is welcome to fish this lake year round with a valid BC freshwater fishing license.

Walleye Fishing Red Lake MN 12-20-2015 Walleye fishing on the huge Red Lake in northern Minnesota is a unique experience. It's divided into an upper and lower portion, and only about half of the upper portion is accessible to most anglers. The other two thirds is part of a Reservation. It gets a large amount of fishing pressure, and 30+ fish days are possible. The daily possession limit is 3 walleyes, and only one fish may be over 17".   An abnormally mild winter meant that the ice was only between 5-9" thick in most spots. Some access points allowed ATVs, while others allowed only foot traffic; however, that's likely to change shortly with a string of colder weather.

Fishing with Rod: 2007 Cultus Lake Pikeminnow Derby The 2007 Cultus Lake pikeminnow derby took place on Saturday June 16th, 2007. This annual derby is part of the All About Fishing Family Event, which is organized by the Fraser Valley Salmon Society.    The goal of the derby is to generate sportfishing interest among the younger generations, as well as assisting Fisheries and Oceans Canada on their Cultus Lake sockeye salmon recovery program. Northern pikeminnow is a predatory species that prey on juvenile salmon. Due to a lack of predators, the population of northern pikeminnow in Cultus Lake has grown to the size that causes a lower return of Cultus Lake sockeye salmon. Fisheries and Oceans Canada hopes to enhance the sockeye population by reducing the northern pikeminnow population.    This event is also part of the province-wide family fishing weekend, which always takes place during the father's day weekend.    Many thanks to Dean Werk and Greg Larson of Great River Fishing Adventures for taking us our on their boats.    If you wish to have your community event covered, please email me at info@fishingwithrod.com    For more information on northern pikeminnow, please visit:  http://www.fishingwithrod.com/fish_profile/northern_pikeminnow.html    For more information on the Cultus Lake sockeye salmon recovery program, please visit:  http://www-sci.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/mehsd/projects/cultus_sockeye_e.htm    For more information on the Fraser Valley Salmon Society, please visit:  http://www.fraservalleysalmonsociety.ca    To see the derby report and results, please visit:  http://www.fishingwithrod.com/yabbse/index.php?topic=14947.0    For more videos such as this, please visit http://www.fishingwithrod.com and subscribe at http://www.fishingwithrod.com/shop    Camera and editing: Rodney Hsu  Music: Chris MacLeod  Production: Fishing with Rod Production ['northern pikeminnow', 'pikeminnow fishing', 'pike minnow fishing', 'Cultus Lake fishing', 'Chilliwack fishing', 'Fraser Valley fishing', 'fishing derby', 'pikeminnow derby', 'pike minnow derby', 'BC fishing', 'fish BC', 'British Columbia fishing', 'Fishing with Rod', 'fishingwithrod.com', 'squawfish fishing', 'northern squawfish']

Commercial Winter Fishing CCPFH visited Dauphin River Manitoba in February and got a rare glimpse of the technique used for commercial ice fishing in the area.  Helgi, Dale and Kris Einarsson welcomed us to their community and showed us what kind of fish they catch and how they catch it during the winter season. The community which normally has approximately 65 commercial fish harvesters has been in a state of evacuation for some time due to massive flooding. Helgi, Dale and Kris were happy to go out on the ice to show us how they do it.

Canadian Ice fishing videos by Pemberton Fish Finder Canadian Ice fishing videos by Pemberton Fish Finder.  It's not tough making Ice fishing videos in British Columbia when you have Thousands of Quality lakes to choose from.  Popular sport fish for Ice fishing in British Columbia include; Rainbow Trout, Kokanee, Brook Trout, Cutthroat Trout, Bull Trout and Lake Trout.  In Northern BC, Grayling and Northern Pike are also common to catch.  Northern British Columbia is a very long drive from where the Pemberton Fish Finder resides, so you will not see to many Northern Pike and Grayling Ice fishing videos on our YouTube Channel.  It is not uncommon to catch Trout over 10 LBS in the Southern half of British Columbia, Canada.  This makes it very easy to make quality Ice fishing videos that will have you begging for more.  Not only is the Ice fishing spectacular in British Columbia, the scenery is jaw dropping.  In every direction there are picture perfect landscapes that include; dense forest, snow covered mountain tops and a lack of human impact.  At most lakes in British Columbia you will feel as if you were the first person there and or you will be the only one Ice fishing that day.  There are thousands of lakes in British Columbia to choose from and numerous lakes with trophy status.  Typically we do not name those Trophy lakes to keep them Trophy lakes.  We always encourage people to practice safe handling of fish.  We also recommend that people release fish unharmed unless they are not fit to be released. Below is a short Canadian Ice fishing videos by Pemberton Fish Finder followed by some pictures.  The lake that we are Ice fishing is one of the many Trophy lakes located in British Columbia.  The Pemberton Fish Finder also offers Full Day Ice fishing tours on this lake.

Bottom Longline Fishing: Discover the story of how halibut and groundfish are harvested Watch how fish harvesters use a bottom longline to catch Pacific halibut, sablefish, rockfish and other groundfish. Baited hooks are attached to a line that is anchored to the ocean floor. A longline can be from one to three miles (1.6 to 5 km) long and have up to 2,000 hooks. The halibut fishery is part of an integrated multi-species fishery in B.C. that allows fish harvesters to keep several species when fishing for halibut.  In B.C., many different species are caught on bottom longlines. These include halibut, sablefish, dogfish, lingcod, flatfish and rockfish. About 150 to 180 vessels actively participate in the halibut fishery each year. The vessels range in size from 35 to 80 feet (20 to 25 metres).  For more info on the B.C.

Winter Storm Ice Fishing - Lake Winnipeg Commercial fishermen, Ed and John, brave a potentially hazardous snowstorm in whiteout conditions to retrieve their catch.  Five miles from shore, without a GPS, they are guided as much by their intuition as their skill in an attempt to navigate the 'frozen tundra'.

Salmon Troll Fishing: Discover the story of how salmon are harvested Watch how fish harvesters use hooks and lines, trailed behind their vessels at low speed, to catch salmon. The hooks are attached to lures that imitate the salmon's food, such as herring and squid. Salmon are individually hooked and the lines are pulled in with a hydraulic winch and a series of poles, pulleys, weights and floats. However, fish harvesters haul in each salmon by hand for the last 20 to 60 feet (6 to 18 metres)—a struggle in which the skill and agility of the harvester is paramount. Troll vessels range in size from 30 to 55 feet and have a crew of two to four. They store their fish on ice or freeze it at sea. Trollers primarily target King Chinook and Silver Coho salmon, but can also catch pink, Keta Chum and Sockeye salmon.

Salmon Gillnet Fishing: Discover the story of how salmon are harvested Fish harvesters use curtains of netting suspended by a system of floats and weights to catch salmon. The fine netting is almost invisible so salmon unwittingly swim into the mesh. As they try to back out, their gill covers get snagged and the fish becomes entangled in the net.  Fish harvesters set their rectangular nets from either the stern or bow of their vessels. Altering the mesh size, the way in which nets are suspended in the water and the amount of time they soak allows fish harvesters to selectively target certain species or sizes. Because of their effectiveness at catching salmon, gill-net fishery openings tend to be relatively short, allowing fish harvesters only hours or a few days to net their catch.  For more info, visit these gillnet fisheries pages:  BC North Coast: http://thisfish.info/fishery/salmon-gillnet-northcoast-bc/ BC Vancouver Island: http://thisfish.info/fishery/salmon-gillnet-vancouverisland-bc/ BC Fraser River: http://thisfish.info/fishery/salmon-gillnet-fraserriver-bc/ BC Barkley Sound: http://thisfish.info/fishery/salmon-firstnations-barkleysound/  CREDITS: Producers: Goodforks Editing: Blue Chip Productions Videography: Kobb Media  Funding support for this video provided, in part, by the BC Government's Buy Local Program; delivered by the Investment Agriculture Foundation of BC with funding from the BC Ministry of Agriculture.

Captain Bob Black & the Pacific Marl Robert Black is the Captain of the Pacific Marl, a wild salmon commercial seine boat based out of Vancouver, Canada.  The Pacific Marl is a 72' vintage wooden hulled fishing boat built in 1927. It's been overhauled a few times over the years from bow to stern and all parts in between, and has a full complement of modern fishing gear, cabin, decks, and rigging.  In preparation for the summer salmon season in Prince Rupert, BC, Bob had his 5 ton net repaired, and this video depicts how he transferred it from the net loft dock into the holds of his boat for the long voyage up north.  Bob invited me along for the short ride between Vancouver and the fishing village of Steveston where his net was repaired and stored.   Along the way we talked in great depth about what he's learned over a period of 40 years as a wild salmon fisherman on the North Pacific of British Columbia.  http://www.WildSalmonCove.com ['wild salmon', 'British Columbia', 'sockeye', 'commercial fishing', 'North Pacific', 'coho', 'chum', 'pinks', 'chinook', 'seine net', 'heritage fishing fleet']

The province of Alberta often stocks their worn out brood stock rainbows into ponds and lakes accross the province.  You can find out which lakes get these stockings by looking at the stocking list published by the province.  These fish average 55 cm but can be as large as 5-7 pounds.  This was my first time out on the ice this year and didn't have the MarCum along.  I sure felt like I was fishing blind but still managed a couple nice rainbows.  These Berkley Powernymphs work really well and are a great alternative if you forget to buy some live bait.

How to Ice Fishing Alberta Ice Monsters Walleye, Northern Pike, Burbot made up one of the most EPIC ice fishing days we've experienced Ice Fishing Alberta.  We were fishing a drop off and the fish were thick, intense and very hungry.  They were hitting soft body swimbaits, slender spoons and large herring on tip ups.  Big walleye, Pike and burbot were attacking our presentations.  It was great to have the MarCum as I feel it helped me hook up on a lot more fish anticipating the bites.  I also show a couple tips on how to lose less lures when fishing for big fish and how to rig a large bait on a tip up.  Hope you enjoy the show.  This is as high octane as ice fishing below - 25 degrees Celcius gets!  Adrenaline rush ice fishing outdoors.  Whoever knew it existed?

Fly Fishing Lillooet River in Pemberton BC Canada Fly Fishing Lillooet River in Pemberton BC Canada.  Fly Fishing Lillooet River in Pemberton BC Canada.  The Rivers in Pemberton, BC are at good levels for this time of year.  The banks have minimal snow and are clear of ice.  The Lillooet river has good visibility.  In this video you will see that there are tons of Bull Trout.  There is also Rainbow Trout and the odd Steelhead.  As the season progresses the fishing only gets better.  In March, Coastal Cutthroat Trout make there way into most streams in the Pemberton area.  This creates some of the best fly fishing in British Columbia, Canada.  While fly fishing for Bull Trout in February use medium to large minnow patterns.  We have also had good luck with flesh patterns.  Flesh patterns work good this time of year because of decomposing Coho Salmon.  We typically don't start fishing the Rivers till mid to late March.  This year with the lack of snow and cold weather in the low laying areas.  We will be able to offer some other incredible fishing opportunities.  The patterns we are using in the video will be featured this Friday night on http://fridaynightflies.com/ .  Join us live each and every Friday night on Friday Night Flies for a fly fishing recipe for the weekend.  The fly patterns are also available at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd at 1380 Birch street in downtown Pemberton, BC.  Whistler and Pemberton's local fly shop.

Fishboat Captain in Police Custody after Drama on the High Seas http://www.ctvvancouverisland.ca http://www.facebook.com/ctvvi  COMOX  - A 49-year-old Comox Valley man is now facing a series of charges as the result of a dramatic police response off the northern tip of Vancouver Island Sunday evening.  Karl Darwin Thomas of Courtenay has been charged with assault with a weapon (knife) uttering threats, pointing a firearm and careless use of a firearm.   Port Hardy police received a 911 call on Sunday evening from a 26-year-old female crew member on the fishing vessel Opal-T saying the boat's skipper was threatening her and a 21-year-old male crew member.  The unidentified woman told police the pair had been assaulted by the captain who was high on cocaine and she feared for their lives because there was a shotgun and several knives on the vessel.  Emergency response members took to the waters and were able to locate the vessel in the area of Browning Passage, near Pine Island, Northeast of Port Hardy.  They were able to successfully maneuver a coast guard vessel near the 30 foot Opal-T to rescue the two crew members.  Police later were able to convince the skipper to return the vessel to Port Hardy where he was taken into custody.  Thomas was scheduled to make an appearance on the charges in Port Hardy Provincial Court Tuesday morning.

51" Musky Ice Fishing | Lake of the Woods NWO Guide Service | Kenora, Ontario Fishing Guide NWO Fishing & Hunting Guide Service Watch NWO fishing guide, Pat James, catch a 51" musky ice fishing on Lake of the Woods in Northwest Ontario.   http://nwowhitetail.com  NWO's ice fishing services are located in Kenora, Ontario in North West Ontario, Canada.   Come experience ice fishing at its finest, with NWO Outfitters on Lake of the Woods or remote inland lake ice fishing packages. The remote inland lake fishing is a chance to hike or snowmobile into natural lakes, sit by an open fire and savor The Great White North. This breath taking experience is complimented further with a winter shore lunch of fresh fish (if preferred). Quite often these outings provide opportunities to view some of the local wildlife.  If warmth and a comfortable chair are more your style, fish in the luxury of 8×12 ft. heated ice shacks that you can drive your truck to. Shack fishing produces jumbo Perch (lots of 11 inchers with some up to 13 inches +). Walleye is plentiful, and with luck, the chance of catching a Lake Trout out of the same holes. Enjoy the best of both worlds and combine both guided Canadian fishing packages with NWO Outfitters in Kenora, Ontario.  NWO Whitetail is based upon giving a world class adventure with experienced guides, great accommodations including our comfortable island camp, low clientele numbers and the use of only prime whitetail deer, fishing and game habitat.  http://nwowhitetail.com ['Fishing', 'lake of woods', 'lake of the woods', 'kenora', 'ontario', 'ice fishing', 'guide', 'fishing guide', 'ice fishing guide', 'musky', 'muskie', 'Canada', 'northwest ontario']

This is a recent re established run that has been open to public harvest again the last few years.  Hundreds or thousands of fish swim up through the lake and stage before going on to spawn in the Okanagan river.  The fish all seem to hang out at the North End of the lake and are usually caught 50-60 feet down.  We were using Les Davis size 0 dodgers with a 13 inch leader, 15 pound fluorocarbon and a pink UV hoochie with a red 3/0 barbless hook.  We added Pro Cure Krill and Shrimp scent to the bait and trolled with downriggers very slowly.  Most strikes came when slowing to a stop or starting from a stop.  These are great tasting fish as well so go give it a try.

Lake Trout Ice Fishing Cold Lake 2014 Went out to Cold Lake for some Lake Trout action twice in January of 2014.  Turns out we just did not hit it right either day on the ice.  The first day only managed to catch one fish period. That was the only bite as well.  This video is from our second day out.  The weather was awesome in the morning but a storm blew in and shut the fish right off.  Caught two lake trout in the first 5 minutes then nothing.  Super slow all day.  They were hitting the smelt on the jaw jacker but getting off before I could even get to the rod.  Lost a few short strikes and then hooked up on the last one in the late afternoon to avoid a skunk for myself.  Slow day and most people left early.  Didn't see anyone catching out there.  Some one drove right through our set up and drove over a tip up breaking it in half.  Why people drive right through a group of 6 people on the ice i'll never know, but several did it out there.  Please respect others out on the ice, keep your distance and happy fishing!

Lac La Biche Northern Pike Fishing Alberta Lac La Biche is a large lake in Northern Alberta and even though it was once fished out it is now coming back and turning into one of the provinces best fisheries year round.  We went to the lake after walleye and the northern pike are always a fun by-catch.  So instead of discarding the footage I thought I'd show off some of our nice pike we caught while in search of Walleye.  The northern pike is a fantastic predator and I love catching the bigger models on rod and reel!

Quarry Lake Grayling Ice Fishing Jaw Jacker Ice Fishing Quarry Lake for Grayling in the beautiful town of Canmore Alberta.  This was my first experience fishing for Grayling as I'd never caught one before.  Everything I read about catching grayling though the ice was not very reassuring.  Seems like they disappear and hide out in the winter.  It was my challenge to catch a grayling through the ice despite Keep Off the Ice signs posted all around the lake because of possible thin ice.  I arrived around noon and slowly made my way onto the ice drilling holes as I went.  The ice was 16-18 inches thick and I set up a Jaw Jacker in 10 feet of water off a sharp drop off with a red chironimid.  In ten minutes it went off and the fight was on.  I tried to get her up the hole but she came off before I could get a shot.  Time passed slow but after a while another Jaw Jacker went off and this time I landed my first Grayling ever.  A nice 12 inch in a beautiful setting.  Hope you enjoy this video.   Merry Christmas Everyone!

Wolf Lake Northern Pike Ice fishing with Windlass Tip-Ups Wolf Lake Fishing for Water Wolves.  We had a super heavy snow year, there was 4 feet of snow in the bush around the lake.  If it weren't for the warm weather and 100 km winds a few days before I don't think we would have got on the lake.  A trapper had made one rutted trail across the lake to his cabin.  Couldn't get out to the spot I had fished before years ago.  So we headed back to a point adjacent a shallow flat dropping into the North lake basin.  Only managed one larger pike, not huge but fun to catch.  Northern Pike were biting great and had flags going constantly, two three at a time.  Great size range of fish in this lake.  All fish caught on Windlass tip ups with quick strike rigs.  Also was fishing with my 2 year old daughter who tried to catch some and got one with the help of mom.

Fishing in Canada: Manitoba Sucker Fishing The term "Sucker" no doubt brings a variety of fishes to mind for Manitoba serves as home province to several members of this fish family: the Longnose and White Suckers, the Shorthead and Silver Redhorses, the Bigmouth Buffalo, and the Quillback.   Spread throughout Manitoba, the Sucker is easily accessible to the angler who can take them from any swiftly flowing clear stream.   Actually you wonít be so much an angler as a netter.  Dipnetting for Suckers in Manitoba is legal and thisis the fastest way to take them. Suckers are present in very large numbers in the spring and netting them takes advantage of this abundancy.  The only thing to remember with dip netting is that any game fish that are inadvertently  caught  must  be  returned  to  the  stream unharmed.  Check with the Manitoba Anglers' Guide to find out where dip-netting is permitted within the province.  You will need a regular sport fishing licence to take Suckers in this way. https://www.gov.mb.ca/waterstewardship/fisheries/education/pdf/sucker.pdf  An angling licence is required while dip netting, seining, or minnow  trapping. In most waters these activities are allowed at any time of the year. Check for closures on specific waters in the divisional sections  of this guide. Species that may be kept include suckers, common carp, burbot, bullheads, tullibee, chub, shiners, darters, dace, fathead minnow, bluntnose minnow, mudminnow, trout-perch, stickleback, sculpin and whitefish. All other species must be released immediately. Live fish may not be transported away from the waters where they were caught. Fish must be dead before transporting. General creel limits apply.

Chicken Ranch Lake Brook Trout Ice Fishing Ice Fishing Chicken Ranch Lake in the early ice season of November and December can produce some great Brook Trout Fishing.  Most of the fish are smaller size but there are some bigger fish that lurk in these waters.  We found that spoons and small jigs tipped with shrimp or night crawlers worked best.  Fish near shore in shallow water during the morning and evening hours for your best chance of catching fish.  Move around till you find the action.  Where you find one often more fish will be soon to follow.  Good luck out there this winter.  Using the Deeper Sonar on this outing if you are wondering what that black ball is.

How to: Fishing Big Spring Pike Pinehurst Lake Alberta Fishing for Big Spring Pike in Shallow water can be very exciting and produce large amounts of fish.  Find shallow water near shallow bays, week and reed beds and you will find the fish.  They fish can often be sight fished in the clear spring water.  Look for areas with high concentrations of baitfish and work them with small to medium swim baits and jerk bait.  These can be highly effective.  These fish are packing on the pounds after the spawn and are highly aggressive.  They will hit your lure multiple times and often chase it right to the boat and jump out of the water to catch the lure as you lift it from the water.  Get out there this spring and enjoy some amazing pike fishing in the skinny water.

How to Catch Mid Summer Walleye Trolling Crankbaits http://www.youtube.com/user/Brandonkop If you want to go out and hook up with some nice summer time walleye, but haven't had much lunck on the water this video is for you.  In August we head out on an Alberta Lake in search of the predator Walleye.  These are very aggressive fish and trolling with plugs or crankbaits can trigger hook ups all summer long.  This presentation helps you cover a lot of ground and actually find the fish first.  Once you've located them you can troll in the general area or stop and fish with some other method.  It was a very bright day with a lot of algae in the water.  The bright colored cranks seemed to be working the best.  The hot lure was a Matzuo multicolor crank.

How to Ice Fishing Alberta Perch and Walleye How to Ice Fish Alberta Perch and Walleye with Slender Spoon.  My uncle and I head out on a new lake to us in search of perch and walleye.  In the morning we tried out a spot we were given a tip about for perch.  We didn't find any perch there but we sure did find the walleye.  After catching a bunch of walleye at sunrise the action cooled down and we headed on the search for perch.  We found some tight lipped perch in deeper water and were able to hook some for dinner.  Once again we headed to where we were earlier in the morning for some evening walleye action and it didn't disappoint.  Hope you enjoy the day out on the ice as much as we did.

Best Walleye Fishing in Alberta Lesser Slave Lake Lesser Slave Lake in Alberta is known for great walleye fishing and this was my first experience on the lake during the hard water season.  Supposedly 90 % of the fish spawn in the river running into the west side of the lake.  Since we were fishing the first week of March and spring was coming it seemed like the West side of the lake would be an obvious choice to try.  We drove onto the lake and noticed a line of ice huts.  We picke a location and drilled some holes and noted these shacks were not on any structure.  So we drilled towards shore until we found to drop off from 30 feet of water up to 10 feet.  As soon as we got onto the drop we started to nail the walleye.  They were very concentrated in this location and the action was steady for the first few hours.  It tapered off later during the day but we continued to catch walleye, pike and tulibee.  In the afternoon we tried our deeper holes near the ice hut depth and ended up catching a couple nice perch and more walley.  What a great day for our first time ice fishing the lake.

Mabel Lake Salmon Fishing Underwater GoPro Hero Mabel Lake British Columbia Underwater Chinook Salmon. Mabel Lake British Columbia Underwater Chinook Salmon. Mabel Lake British Columbia Underwater Chinook Salmon. Mabel Lake British Columbia Underwater Chinook Salmon. Mabel Lake British Columbia Underwater Chinook Salmon.  Fishing for Chinook Salmon at Mabel Lake in British Columbia for the first time turned out a big skunk for me.  The salmon were rolling and jumping on the surface, but none were biting.  Good thing I had the camera down since I at least caught a glimpse of these magnificent salmon during their spawn run through Mabel lake and up the Shuswap River.  They seemed most interested in a green hoochie and dodger.  Someone else out there caught two on the same combo.

Atlantic Salmon Fishing at The Salmon Lodge & Camp Bonaventure of Gaspé, Quebec The Salmon Lodge: http://thesalmonlodge.com Camp Bonaventure: http://www.campbonaventure.com  The two sister lodges of Camp Bonaventure and The Salmon Lodge are located in the pristine peninsula of Gaspé, Quebec, yet situated on different rivers.  Both offer a world of adventure for even the most discriminating fly-fishing enthusiast. These rivers are known for their big salmon due to how well the populations have been protected and how regulated the fishing is here. Many world record salmon were caught on these rivers.  The Salmon Lodge is one of Quebec’s most reputable and historic Atlantic salmon fishing lodges. Built in the late 1800’s, Salmon Lodge has been welcoming Atlantic salmon fishing enthusiasts to the world-famous Grand Cascapedia valley for over a century.  Camp Bonaventure is nestled in a natural stand of white birches on the banks of the Bonaventure River, known as “perhaps the clearest salmon river in the world”.

Sturgeon fishing trips in British Columbia Canada Sturgeon fishing trips in British Columbia Canada.  We offer some of the best Sturgeon fishing in the World.  Enjoy a short jet boat ride through the scenic Fraser River canyon in Lillooet, BC while in pursuit of the World's largest freshwater fish.  Sturgeon are plentiful in the section of water we fish on the Fraser River.  It is common to see 10 Sturgeon a trip, if your arms can deal with it ;).  The Sturgeon on our section of the Fraser River average in length between 5' - 7' and weigh in at a staggering 150 - 200 LBS.  Last year our largest Sturgeon was 12 feet in length and weighed nearly 1000 LBS.  We hook Sturgeon larger than this fairly regularly but with the swift current of the upper Fraser River section that we fish it makes it difficult to land them.  It still makes for some spectacular aerial displays and 200 yard reel screaming runs.  Our Sturgeon fishing equipment is geared for Big Fish.  We always recommend our clients do a few bicep and tricep stretches the night before Sturgeon fishing in British Columbia Canada.  Be prepared for a workout!  Imagine being hooked into this massive Sturgeon and watching it thrust it's massive body out of the water right in front of you.  It definitely makes a great conversation piece and great photographs.  May is a great time of the year to fish for Sturgeon and the weather is favorable.  The water is very cold and the air temperature hovers in the mid 20's Celsius which is great t-shirt and shorts weather.  Make sure you bring a camera, footwear you don't mind getting wet and your sunscreen along.  Be ready for a Sturgeon fishing trip of a lifetime, a fishing trip lifelong memories are made of.  Sturgeon Fishing May Madness Right now, through the Month of May and the first week of June we are putting an all inclusive Sturgeon Fishing package together for you. This Sturgeon fishing package includes Your accommodation. All of the Sturgeon fishing equipment. A jet boat operated by a Captain with nearly 10 years experience running the Upper Fraser River. A tasty shore lunch 8 hours fishing Some of the best Sturgeon fishing in the World. Pricing is as follows 2 people - $700. +GST 3 people - $900. +GST 4 people - $1000. + GST For more information about our Sturgeon fishing trips in British Columbia Canada call toll Free (877)905-8121 or email info@pembertonfishfinder.com .  Sturgeon fishing is best enjoyed in groups, this way the option of passing off the rod to fresh arms is available.  Our Group rate for 4 people is the best bargain, simple math $250 a person which includes your accommodations.  It's tough to beat that price! Sturgeon fishing video and pictures The Sturgeon fishing video and pictures below were filmed May 10th, 2016.  All of the Sturgeon were caught in the matter of 4 hours.  We landed 4 sturgeon and lost 2 in this short window.  Most of that time was spent on the rods reeling in Sturgeon.  All Sturgeon were released unharmed. We look forward to Sturgeon fishing with you, Pemberton Fish Finder. https://pembertonfishfinder.com/ ['Sturgeon fishing trips in British Columbia Canada', 'best Sturgeon fishing in the World', 'Fraser River', "World's largest freshwater fish", 'huge sturgeon', 'Sturgeon jumping', 'Sturgeon Fishing May', 'Sturgeon fishing video', 'sturgeon pictures', 'Sturgeon fishing tours in Canada', 'Sturgeon fishing trips in BC', 'Sturgeon fishing trips in Canada', 'Fraser river Sturgeon fishing in Canada', 'sturgeon fishing', 'sturgeon fishing guides', 'Sturgeon fishing guides BC']

Simple Carp Fishing with Big Results Welcome to today's episode of Thundermist Fishing Tips. Today we're out on Lake Eerie on a windy day, so we've tucked ourselves into a little alcove to fish for carp.  We're geared up with the new T-Turn bait rig, size #6B circle hooks made specifically for carp. We've baiting the hook with corn, taken from a thawed bag of frozen corn. To help entice the carp into the area, I've tossed out a few handful of corn to help scent the area.  With the circle hooks, the advantage is that you don't need to set the hook. You just need to start reeling.  In some states corn is not legal, so a great alternative is to use boilies, or even balled up pieces of bread.

Trolling for Sea Bass with the American Smelt Crank Bait We're back here on the saltwaters of Buzzards Bay. The winds were south-west all week, however today they have shifted and are now coming from the east. They say "east is least and west is best" when it comes to fishing, but we're going to shake things up and troll with these brand new realistic American Smelt crank baits and hope that does the trick.  These American Smelt crank baits will dive down about 18 to 20 feet. We're all going to run with different colors to start, and narrow down on a specific color if we find one color is producing more fish than the others.  We're trolling at about 4 to 5 mph. It might be the American Smelts, but we definitely put the term "east to least" to shame as two minutes in we got our first of many hook-ups!

Big Early Season Walleye and Trout - Flexi Jigs and Live Minnow T-Turn Rigs Hello folks, today is a great day. It's the first day we're able to get back out onto the (non-frozen) water - and boy did we have a great day!  We geared up with our trusty flexi-jigs with artificial bait fish, and t-turn rigs with live minnows. It didn't take long before we were heavy into the fish - both big lake trout and walleye!  The water was about 32°F or 0°C, and the lake trout and walleye were hitting hard.  It was a fantastic day back.

Triple Headers! Jigging with a Powerful Combination Rig: Bucktails and Teaser-T's Double headers, and triple headers. Today was definitely a great day out on the wonderful saltwater of Buzzards Bay in Cape Cod, fishing with our new combination rig: the powerful flexi-jig paired with the new inline teaser-t's.  We're drifting along, jigging these bucktails along the bottom. With the  in-line teasers above it, a lot of times will catch you more fish, and sometimes even bigger fish. But what I also like is you have the opportunity to catch two at a time.

Jigging for Lake Trout with the Stingnose Jigging Spoon I'm out at the mouth of the Niagara River today, geared up with the Stingnose jigging spoons targeting lake trout.  It's late December, and it's been a warm enough winter that I was able to launch the boat and get at the mouth Niagara River to jig for lake trout. Last time we were out here, we were getting some nice little fish.  I'm using jigging the stingnose about 4-6 inches off of the bottom while drifting along. Specifically I'm switching between the  1-3/4oz Stingnose, and a 3/4oz Stingnose depending on which one produces more fish.  It was about three casts in before we started landing fish. I had a great day out here jigging for lake trout!

How to Ice Fish for Perch - Ice Fishing Jigging Tips and Tricks We are out here with Antonio, the boatless angler, and we're out here using some Stingnose jigging spoons and we're ice fishing for perch. We're getting a larger mixed bag of sizes when compared to last week.   If you'd like to get your own Stingnose, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=66  We have a strategic spot that we're fishing at today. We're fishing specifically on top of the 'white ice' - the area of the ice which is either covered in snow, or otherwise solid white and opaque.   This snow-covered ice helps give some cover to the fish down below, and helps shield us from the fish. As the water we're fishing today is very clear.  If we were sitting on the clear ice, the fish might be able to see us, and be startled by our movements. If you have the chance to fish a snow-covered area, that will help your day out on the ice.  Right now my line is about 6 to 8 inches off of the bottom and that's where the fish are currently holding. When you jig for perch, panfish, or even walleye, there are many different jigging techniques which you can use.  I'm mainly using a slower lift and drop technique to start. Sometimes jiggling the line a bit, or giving a very slow lift. You can also use a more aggressive snap, which makes the lure look like a minnow darting away. Vary your technique to feel out which is working for the fish. Sometimes subtle works, where sometimes big aggressive motions work.  The key with any technique is to always provide a pause - as the pause or the downward motion of the lure tends to be when the fish will strike.

Spring Shore Fishing for Bullhead and Big Channel Catfish It's early spring, and the weather is starting to warm up. This makes it perfect for spring bullhead and channel catfish.  We're geared up today with a dual T-Turn rig and cut bait. Normally we use cut bait for channel catfish, but cut bait also works great for bullhead.  The beauty about baiting up with cutbait is that is tends to catch the larger bullheads.

Flat Line Trolling for Lake Trout in the Morning It's bright and early, and we're out here on Lake Ontario flat line trolling for lake trout. We had every fisherman's good luck sign come true: got a hook up on the first cast!  Water temp is 41 degrees Fahrenheit out here on Lake Ontario this morning. The technique today is quick and simple. We ran the American Smelt crankbaits attached straight to the line. No weights, no down riggers, no planar boards. Just let flat-lining.  We're trolling in about 20-25 feet deep water at the mouth of the Niagara River, at about 2.5mph. We're letting out most of our fishing line, as we want our bait as far from the boat as possible as to not spook the fish.   To gain maximum depth with the lure, keep your rod tip down while trolling for lake trout. If you have your rod in something like a rod holder which keeps the tip high in the air, it'll pull your crankbait higher, and out of the lower strike zone.  Rod tip down, 2.5mps, and give your line a little twitch every so often to give the lure an added bit of life. Some trick on flat lining for lake trout!

How to Troll for Smallmouth Bass (With Fast Fish-Catching Action) Today we're out on the water with Enzo out on Lake Eerie's eastern basin at 5am, trolling for smallmouth bass.  We're trolling with the misty minnows, which are realistically shaped crankbait minnows. I'm using a medium natural colour, and Enzo is using the silver blue.  We're looking for smallmouth today and we're going to troll for them through about 10 feet of water or shallower, ideally between 6 and 12 feet. The medium misty minnows drive about 6 feet, so they are perfect for trolling for smallmouth bass, keeping us down to the bottom.  We're going to troll as slow as we can, which is about 3mps with our outboard. We're going to work our way around the shoreline.  Today's episode is loaded with great trolling for smallmouth bass paired with lots of fish catching action!

How to Spool Line onto your Reel and Prevent Fishing Line Twist While Spooling Spinning Reels A long time ago we made a video on how to spool a spinning reel to prevent line twist: however it was at low quality, and was hard to see the line.  So we've redone it (due to massive popular demand). So now you can learn how to spool a spinning reel to prevent line twist in HD and with a visible fishing line.  Here at Thundermist Lure Company, we've been asked several times "How do I spool line onto my reel properly?", and "How can I avoid fishing line twist".   So we've put together a short 4-minute video with 4 key tips on how to spool line onto your reel and preventing line twist.  Let know what you think about this by commenting below, or send us an email through our blog.  As always, good fishing!

Tips on Bottom Drifting for Fluke, Black Sea Bass, Scup/Porgie with the Viper Spoons Hello folks. Today we're out in the waters of Cape Cod bottom drifting for fluke, black sea bass, and those nice little scups (also know as porgies).  We've rigged up with a viper spoon to add flash and flutter to our cut squid bait, a cattail sinker to keep us from getting snagged on the bottom, and a t-turn swivel to keep our lines tangle-free.  As mentioned in the video, if you'd like to get your own viper spoons, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=52  While on our bottom bouncing drifts, we've pulled up a nice mixed bag of fish.

Huge Top Water Striper Triple-Header! Crazy Top Water Action! We find ourselves back in the saltwater, this time using top water plugs targeting striper and bluefish.  For attached your top water plug to your line, you can tie it direct, though I suggest using a simple duo-lock snap - not a snap swivel.  To fish these top waters lure, especially in top water, I like to run them a little more aggressively. When the lure hits the water I reel in about 3 to 4 cranks really fast, then pause, then 3 to 4 cranks really fast again. As you're reeling, the lure is making all these bubbles and splashes on the water, and with the pause it gives the perfect moment for stripers or blues to hammer it!  When you're using top water baits, it's very important to pause just for a second or two before setting the hook. I can't tell you how many times I've pulled the lure right from the fishes mouth pulling right away. Give the fish a moment to take the lure underwater.  I like the top water plugs that have the open rounded mouth to create that all that splash and sound, moreso than the 'walk the dog' style of top water baits which slide or zig-zag over the top of the water.

Boatless Angler - Tips on Shore Fishing for Bullhead Catfish in the Spring Welcome to today's boatless angler edition of Thundermist Fishing Tips. Today we're out on the shoreline fishing for bullhead catfish - which is a favourite of ours.  Antonio and I are rigged with a simple set up of a basic two t-turn rig: one t-turn to a hook above the sinker, and another t-turn tied on and a line going about a foot below the sinker.   For bait, we caught ourselves some leaf worms.  When fishing for bullhead, the long shank hooks are very handy, especially when trying to get the hook out of the fishes mouth.

How to Catch Big Carp Using a T-Turn Sliding Sinker Rig Hello folks. Today I'd like to share a video about how to catch carp using a T-Turn sliding sinker rig, and the benefits of this set up.  The T-Turn can be used in many different ways, today it's part of a sliding sinker rig. The T-Turn works as a sinker stop, while allowing me to fish with two hooks at different lengths. All that in addition to preventing line twists.  With the sliding sinker rig, this allows the carp to take the hook and run with it for a bit. Preventing the carp from feeling the sinker and getting spooked.  It works so well that on this early spring day we landed multiple 20lb+ carp!

How to Catch Walleye & Lake Trout using Live Minnows on a T-Turn Bait Rig Click here to subscribe for more fishing videos: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?=add_user=thundermistlures  We're out here in the Niagara River and of course Antonio had to get his line in the water first. Before I even had a chance to bait my T-Turn bait rig, Antonio was already landing the first lake trout of the day!  With our T-Turn bait rigs, we've baited them up with live minnows and we're slowly bouncing them along the bottom with a slow-and-pause retrieve.  The T-Turn bait rigs are a new product we've been using, and so far I've loved using them. It's the classic T-Turn rig that I always turn to, except pre-rigged and ready to go.

Winter Steelhead and Bass using the T Turn Bait Rig and Live Minnows Welcome to today's winter episode of Thundermist Fishing Tips!  We have Vincenzo with us today, along with the boatless angler himself, Antonio. Today we're going to be running the T-Turn Bait Rig baited up with our own self-caught live bait - minnows. We made a stop before getting on the water to use a dip net and pull ourselves a day's worth of great live bait.  Antonio and myself are running a single T-Turn Bait Rig, though Vincenzo has opted for the two-hook T-Turn Bait Rig.  We're fishing the upper Niagara River, which is our way of starting off the new year. We should be out ice fishing, though that's alright, what a bonus it is to be out on the open water for a little longer.  We're drifting the river with the live bait rigs, and you never know what you're going to catch. This set up is great for a wide variety of fish: brown trout, lake trout, perch, silver bass, walleye - who knows. Today we're fishing for anything that bites!  It didn't take long before we got ourselves in a nice triple smallmouth bass header! We even managed to get ourselves a few other bonus fish, like a lovely steelhead!

Shore Fishing in the Winter Snow for Rainbow Trout - How To Fish for Winter Rainbows Hello folks. It's mid December and quite cold - but still perfect for fishing.   The snow along with ourselves are out on the chilly shorelines of Lake Erie. We're baited up roe bags, T-Turns, and heavy sinkers as we fish the shoreline drift for rainbow trout.  Rainbow trout thrive is this cold fresh water, and now is the perfect time to catch some of these beautiful trout. We let the current take our roe bags as we bounce our bait along the bottom.   Having a heavy sinker helps our bait keep down in the current, as the T-Turn 3-Way Swivel keeps our lines tangle-free. It's a perfect combo for this fishing.

Catching Lake Trout with Live Bait on the T-Turn Bait Rig (Live Minnows) Today we're running with live bait (live minnows) on a dual T-Turn bait rig, and we're fishing for lake trout!  These T-Turn Bait Rigs come pre-rigged with fluorocarbon line, a snap, and two T-Turns out to two hooks. With this rig I've snapped on a 1oz Cattail sinker to the bottom, which is great as it allows my sinker to walk over the rocks, helping keep me out of any snags.  The bait rig is really something I've been enjoying fishing with as the T-Turns keep my lines tangle free as I'm able to run two baits, letting the minnows swim freely.  If you want to get your own bait rigs, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=71  We're going to get our lines all the way down to the bottom, and just drift. This is why the Cattail sinker is key, keeping our sinker from getting snagged on the bottom.  For line type, we're running with Thunderbraid line with a fluorocarbon leader.  It only took about 30 seconds before we hooked into our first lake trout!

Half-Dozen Pike Through the Ice - Ice Fishing Tips Using Shiners and Tip-ups Hello folks. We're deep into the winter months now and as always it's still the perfect time to go fishing.  Today we're out on the ice, just north of Kingston Ontario, geared up with tip-ups, light-action ice fishing rods, T-Turn swivels, and live shiners, as we fish just a couple feet below the ice for those northern pike.  Other than me losing (and then finding) my fishing rod through the ice, we caught ourselves about a half-dozen pike while sharing many great ice fishing tips and techniques.

Cold Water Smallmouth Bass Fishing - Stingnose Jigging Spoon for Chunk Smallmouth I have everyone's favourite boatless angler with us today, and we're out on the water in some nice cold -2 degree Celsius weather. We're all bundled up in full gear and even have on some nice toques.  Click here to subscribe for more fishing videos: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?=add_user=thundermistlures  It's the last day of smallmouth bass fishing up here in Canada, specifically in the southern Ontario region.  Today we're running the brand new Stingnose jigging spoons, and we're jigging in about 50 feet of water. The water temp is about 47 degrees Fahrenheit. Which means that the smallmouth bass are starting to really school up, and feed in prep for the winter. The Stingnose size we're running with specifically is 1 3/4 oz. Which is the perfect size for this cold water depth.  If you'd like to get your own Stingnose jigging spoons, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=66  A good tip/trick when it comes to vertically jigging, is the classic jig and pause technique. Many times, the smallmouth bass will hit the lure right on that pause.  It was such a great day out on the water today catching those nice chunky smallmouth bass. We couldn't be more pleased with these new Stingnose jigging spoons.  It was definitely a great way to end the smallmouth bass fishing season!

Perch Fishing with Live Minnows - Using the T-Turn Bait Rig We are fishing in Lake Erie out of Port Colborne today, and we're running a double T-Turn rig for perch. We use a 2 T-Turn rig, which will eventually be available for sale early 2016. This particular t-turn rig we refer to is a pan-fish rig - perfect for perch! For bait we're using live minnows.  Click here to subscribe for more fishing videos: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?=add_user=thundermistlures  The sinker we have on is 1.5oz, and we're fishing in 65 feet of water. The heavy sinker is getting us down to the bottom real quick, and will keep our lines as vertical as possible, which helps us keep more control over our line while drifting along for those perch. We're using two drift socks to keep our drift nice and slow, but still let us cover some water.  For fun, we brought with us ultra-light rods. Which makes even the smallest of pan fish feel like a nice bass. Except for when we caught that bass.  We're also running 6 lb test line, which is a nice amount when fishing for perch.

Trolling for Lake Trout Using the Prototype Thundermist Crank Bait, the American Smelt Series Hello folks! Today we're out here with the Boatless Angler himself, and we're fishing Lake Ontario close to the mouth of the Niagara River, trolling in about 20 feet of water.  When fishing out here in late April, you have the chance to hook into many different kinds of fish - including lake trout.  Today we're out trolling with a prototype of a brand new crank bait called the American Smelt - coming out this summer. It was an action-packed day and we couldn't be any happier with these upcoming crank baits. The action is hot, even though it's been a cold spring.

Trolling Tips for Big Winter Lake Trout in Lake Ontario Today we're out there at the mouth of Lake Ontario, doing something I normally wouldn't do until the spring: trolling for lake trout. This time I'm trolling right at the top of winter using the new American Smelt crankbaits.   Click here to subscribe for more fishing videos: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?=add_user=thundermistlures  Normally we would not be able to troll for lake trout in the winter, though the warmer weather we've been having made for the perfect opportunity.  These American Smelts are going to drive down to the perfect depth of about 16 to 20 feet deep. If you'd got thinner diameter fishing line, the American Smelt crankbait will dive about 20 feet, though if you have thicker diameter fishing line, it'll dive down to about 16 feet. It's surprising, but fishing line does make a difference.  If you want to get your own American Smelt crankbaits, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=68  Today I'm trolling with a slow action rod. The action of a fishing rod describes the how much of the whole rod will bend when pressure, or in the case of reeling in a big lake trout, the pulling on the tip of the rob.  A slow action rod has a long bend, almost all the way down to the handle.  Slow action rods are perfect for trolling because it takes up a lot of the line when you go to set the hook, and helps give that fish an extra chance to get into that bait. Similar to how braided fishing line has less give than fluorocarbon. Compared to a fast action rod would have a much faster hook set. Which would be preferred in many other fishing situations.  Today we're going to cover a lot of ground, and as hoped, we got ourselves into our fair share of big winter lake trout!

What Catches More Carp, Corn or Boilies? (Shore Fishing for Carp) I'm here with Antonio, the boatless angler today fishing for carp. When it comes to fishing the shore lines, there's a lot of great boatless angler opportunities for carp fishing, especially along the shores of Lake Erie Ontario.  Today we're running a T-Turn sliding sinker rig, complete with a standard sinker with lines to two hooks. Although today we're trying something special with bait. Normally we would fish with corn, however since many states and provinces do not allow corn as bait, we figured we're put different baits to the test to find out if people are "missing out" if they are unable to use corn as bait.   We aim to answer the question: what catches more carp, corn or boilies?  When it comes to fishing line, today we're spooled up with ThunderBraid with a ThunderCarbon leader. One great advantage to using braided fishing line when fishing for carp, is that you can add more line to your spool - which helps with those powerful carp make a run for it.  We had a tremendous day on the shore today as we landed a surprising amount of carp.   Which do you think was better, corn or boilies? The answer might surprise you.

Shore Fishing for Salmon on the Fraser River, BC Today we're on the shoreline of the Fraser River in British Columbia. I've never fished for salmon on the Fraser River before, and I'm glad you can join me today.  The Chinook salmon run is pretty much over, but there are still a few opportunities left to get into coho and chum salmon.  For using artificial baits while fishing for salmon, I prefer to run a spoon, such as the python darter; crankbaits, like the misty minnow or the American smelt; or spinners. Today I'm lucky enough to run a prototype spinner from Thundermist Lures.  With this spinner, I'll be giving it a nice slow retrieve from the shoreline. The flash and fluttering of the blade should work in enticing a salmon hit.   I'd also like to point out that it's not early in the morning, but rather mid-afternoon. The time of day doesn't matter as much for two reasons. It's tidal water (incoming tide) along with scattered light rain showers and overcast skies.  We're also running with barbless hooks today.

How to Catch Sunfish and Bluegills through the Ice - Ice Fishing for Sunfish and Panfish Hello folks, we're out here in February with Antonio, the boatless angler. We're out on the winter ice, ice fishing for those wonderful panfish. Specifically today we're aiming for sunfish and bluegills.  Originally I was baited up with crickets, however after Antonio catches sunfish after sunfish, it was clear that his wax worms were out fishing the crickets 10 to 1.

Boatless Angler - Tips on Catching Suckers from Shore - Excellent Catfish Bait Hello folks, this week we're on the shorelines baited up with tiny hooks and live worms as we catch the very tricky "sucker".  We're rigged up with a simple Thunder Braid line, T-Turn, sinker, and hook setup with live worms balled onto the hook. This helps keep the bait on the hook, and prevents the sucker from taking your bait.  Sucker are a very tricky fish to catch. Their bites are very very subtle.

Flat-Lining for Bluefish with the SS Viper Spoons Hello folks. This week we're drifting in some rougher saltwaters, fighting some heavy winds and rains as we drift for Bluefish.  We're rigged up with SS20 Viper Spoons baited with strips of cut bait. Not using any weights, as we're letting our Viper Spoons drift out about 75 feet. The lack of weight keeps the lure closer to the surface, and right in the bluefish zone.  Thanks for watching.  As always until next time good luck, and god fishin'!

How to Secure your Hook/Jig on your Rod for Travel and Storage | Thundermist Quick Fishing Tip Hello folks, this week we'd like to share a quick fishing tip on how to store your jig/hook on your rod while travelling, or storing your set up.  Often I've seen people place their hooks inside the ceramic eye of their fishing rod. Although this might seem fine, in essence it can create a serious problem. Over time the hook will wear away at the smoothness of the eye. A damaged eye on your rod will cause your line to fray or even cut it straight off.

Casting Crank Baits for Sea Bass We're out on the saltwater with Antonio, the Boatless Angler. We're running the American Smelt crankbaits. I'm running the blue colour, and Antonio is running the natural colour.   A good tactic to use with these suspending crankbaits is to reel and pause. At the pause, the crankbait will stay suspended, making it appear similar to an injured bait fish.  ▶ Click here to subscribe for more fishing videos: http://bit.ly/thundermist  Follow our ongoing fishing adventures Instagram: http://bit.ly/thundermist-instagram Facebook: http://bit.ly/thundermist-facebook Twitter: http://bit.ly/thundermist-twitter Store: http://thundermistlures.com  As always until next time, good luck and good fishin'!

Drifting for Coho Salmon with a Bonus Big Lake Trout Hello folks! We have a windy day on us, too windy to get out onto the lake. So we've moved into the Lower Niagara River, right at the mouth of Lake Ontario for this cloudy, overcast day. Our goal: trout and coho salmon.  We are running with a T-Turn set up down to a Cattail Sinker to help keep us tangle free, and snag free. We've opened up with an artificial minnow, as the seagulls in the areas were driving for bait fish.  The key to bottom bouncing, is to keep contact with the bottom. When you feel your line start to lift, either switch to a heavier sinker, or let out additional line. The Cattail Sinker helps keep the sinker was getting snagged as it hugs the river bottom.  Even though we missed the morning bite, due to the overcast day the trout and salmon bite was on all afternoon. As you can imagine, we had a fantastic day on the water. Even if I did manage to break our fishing net on the thick lake trout.  Thanks for watching and until next time, good luck and good fishin'!

Boatless Angler - Shoreline Fishing for Channel Catfish and Bullhead Catfish Hello folks, this week we have a great episode of The Boatless Angler for you. We head down to the shoreline and literally out on a limb to catch some huge channel catfish and some much smaller bullhead catfish.  After the Boatless Angler finds himself falling knee deep in the cold spring waters, he's able to land himself a huge channel cat weighing in at least 20 pounds.  Meanwhile I've baited up with manure worms and catch some much smaller bullhead catfish. We even managed to catch ourselves another fishing rod.

Fishing Q&A - Rod Lengths, Line Strength, Best Pike Bait, and Bass Fishing Times Welcome to another Fishing Q&A video, where we take some time to answer some great fishing questions we've received.  Today we have three different questions I'd like to answer and talk about; the questions today are about different topics entirely.  Question 1: What length of rod to you use when you are jigging for walleye? I would think a 7th medium action rod with 10 lb braid with a 6 or 10 lb fluorocarbon leader.  Question 2: What baitfish do you recommend for pike fishing?  Question 3: Is night time better for striped bass?  Thank you again to all our great subscribers.

Fishing Q&A - Invasive Carp, Murky Water Carp, and Carp Locations Today's Fishing Q&A is all about carp!  Question 1: I love carp fishing but there's no way that you can say they aren't invasive. They have been here for more than 200 years but they were still brought here from Europe. By definition they are invasive.  Question 2: There are some lakes where carp are uncatchable, and some lakes where it's easy to catch carp. Why is that?  Question 3: Are carp found in ponds?

T-Turn Live Bait Rig for Catching Smallmouth Bass (Live Minnows) I'm here with Antonio today, and we're out on the Niagara River. We're going to spend a little bit of time, only an hour, running live bait on a T-Turn bait rig.  The water is about 15 feet deep here in the river, and we're just going to toss our line in, get it all the way down to the bottom, and then slowly bounce it around as we drift. The key is to keep a slightly tight line as you're bouncing your bait along the bottom.  You never know what you're going to catch when you're using live bait. Today we landed ourselves a double header of nice sizes smallmouth bass!  Our T-Turn bait rig were baited up with live minnows, and we are spooled up with 6 lb thundercarbon line.

Night Bite Walleye on the Flexi-Jig Today we have a special night time fishing for walleye episode. We were on the verge of a weather front moving in, so we quickly geared up and headed out into the rainy night.  Because it's night, it is the perfect opportunity to run a glow bait. Naturally, I turned straight to the glow flexi-jig. I'm working the flexi-jig right along the bottom, having it baited up with a minnow-type artificial bait while Antonio is fishing for these night time walleye with a minnow T-Turn bait rig.  Walleye have great vision at night, and the glow bait adds that extra advantage.  If you want to get your own glow flexi-jigs, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=49  People often write in and ask "When is the best time to catch walleye from shore?", and one of those best times is at night. What happens is at night the walleye move in from the deeper waters towards the shoreline looking to feed. Which as you can imagine, gives the boatless angler a great advantage.  I'm running braided fishing line while jigging today, which is my preferred line type for jigging as it really lets me feel the action. Especially at night, when visibility is down.  It only took two casts before we landed ourselves a large night time walleye!  We had a great night on the water and I hope you enjoy today's fishing catching episode!

New Crank Baits! The Realistic Misty Minnow and Cranking for Silver Bass We're proud to announce the new crankbait series, the American Smelt and the Misty Minnow! Both style of crankbaits are hand-crafted to be lifelike versions of smelts and minnows.  They come in a variety of sizes and in 6 fish-catching colors:  Silver/Purple, Silver, Gold, Silver/Chartreuse, Silver/Blue, and Natural.  if you want to get your own Misty Minnows, or want more information on them, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=67  Today we're fishing the mouth of the Detroit River, at Lake St. Clair. We're running the just release Misty Minnow crankbaits, as we fish for silver bass.  If you've never caught silver bass. They are a lot of fun to catch, and are very tasty.  Those Misty Minnows did a great job of catching those silver bass. Right away, in one our first casts, the Misty Minnow hooks into a silver bass immediately as it hit the water top.  The silver bass were definitely feeding top water today, as the water tops not only had swirls, but had a large amount of may flies on the survive which the silver bass were feeding off of.  We're very pleased with the new Misty Minnows, we're using the medium sizes today, as they dive about 4/5 feet, as the fish were fishing near the top of the water. The Misty Minnows do a great job as mimicking the look and feel of a real minnow.  You can catch silver bass from shore, though today we're drifing along to cover a wider range of water. The winds are blowing us towards the mouth of the river, following along with the current.   We even landed a few double headers!  if you wanted to get your own Misty Minnows, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=67   Follow our ongoing fishing adventures Instagram: http://instagram.com/thundermistlures Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thundermistlures Twitter: http://twitter.com/thundermist Web: http://thundermistlures.com  As always until next time, good luck and good fishin'!

Fishing Q&A - Spinning vs Baitcasting Reels, Baits for Grass Carp, and Tricky Fishing Today's Fishing Q&A is about the difference between spinning reels and baitcasting reels, what are good baits for grass carp, and how to fish in areas where there is a lot of debris.   Question 1: So I went fishing 3 times, and I saw that a lot of fishermen use spinning rod and reels., while I was the only one with the baitcaster. I was wondering, what will be better: a spinning rod and reel combo (RARC) or a baitcasting RARC. For me, I'm on a budget and I want to get a second medium strength RARC that will serve me a all around fishing combo (I normally fish in freshwater's, and the biggest fish in my state is a Northern pike and Channel Catfish) and I target Largemouth, catfish of all types, trout, and other fishes in that region. What should I get, a spinning RARC or a another baitcasting RARC?

Any suggestions about fishing with spoons or any other artificial lure in those areas?  Thank you again to all our great subscribers.

Bottom Bouncing for Brown Trout in the Fall Hello folks! It's a nice day in November, and as such we're out drifting the waters for Brown Trout with artificial roe bags. It's a cold fall day, but it makes for a nice day on the water when fishing for brown trout.   We used a 2 T-Turn approach today, each down to a hook. One hook a little lower, one hook a little higher. This keeps one hook above the sinker, off the bottom and away from snags, while keeping the bait in the strike zone. With the upper hook helping entice those brown trout which are suspended.  We use a very heavy sinker to help keep the line vertical, keep out of out snags, and help keep us in the strike zone, all while giving good tactile feedback of the bottom.  We're using Thunder Braid today, with a fluorocarbon leader to keep the baited part of the line invisible to the brown trout.

Fishing Line Series - Advantages and Disadvantages of Monofilament Fishing Line - Part 1 Hello folks, this week we have the first of three parts where we go into detail on the different types of fishing line and the advantages and disadvantages of each type: monofilament, braided, and fluorocarbon fishing line.  Today we go over the advantages and disadvantages of fishing with monofilament fishing line. For example, monofilament fishing line absorbs water and light, which both weaken the line. However monofilament fishing line provides the angler with some stretch - an advantage and disadvantage depending on how you're fishing.  Stay tuned next time for part two of our fishing line series, and their advantages and disadvantages.  As always good luck, and good fishing'!

Ice Fishing Tips for Perch Today's episode we're finally out on the ice fishing for those lovely winter perch. We've got the boatless angler with us today along with the rest of the Thundermist crew.  We're out in Lake Simcoe on Cook's Bay right at the end of January. It's been a very warm winter this year, and this is the first time we've had a chance to get out onto some safe ice. Right now we're standing on about 8-10 inches of ice.   We're not using any bait today, as we're running the Stingnose jigging spoons. It's so realistic that it looks like a minnow all on it's own. The hook is placed right on the head of the minnow, which is where fish tend to hit first. They are perfect for lightly jigging close to the bottom.   If you'd like to get your own Stingnose jigging spoons, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=66  We brought the ice fishing hut with us today, though we're not going to use it. The advantage of not using the hut is it gives us the option of being mobile if the hole we're fishing for perch at are producing smaller fish.   We brought the power auger with us, and without needing to setup and tear down a hut, we're able to walk about, drilling more hole as needed. It also helps that today's weather was well above freezing.

How to Catch Mackerel We're out here today in Cape Cod, on calm waters jigging for mackerel, and we'd like to show you how to catch mackerel.  Primarily, we're drifting in waters about 70' deep, though targeting suspended Atlantic mackerel about 30' to 20' deep. I'm fishing with a custom rig of a stingnose jigging spoon at the bottom, with two teaser-t's tied above it.  How to cook mackerel with no fishy taste: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhltppaVycU  You can buy already pre-rigged mackerel rigs and they work great to catch mackerel. Though today I wanted to try a slightly different mackerel rig. Both are very effective at catching mackerel.  The technique we're using is a simple drop and jig technique. The hardest part is getting your line in the target line. A good way is to use a line counter on your reel.  Mackerel tend to move in large schools. So often you'll go through periods of nothing, then suddenly slam into a frenzy of them. This makes for an exciting day on the water!

Catching Smallmouth Bass with the Stingnose and In-Line Teaser Combo We're going smallmouth bass fishing today!  Today we're here with Antonio, our boatless angler, and we're running Stingnose jigging spoons for smallmouth bass - except we've added a special bonus, an in-line teaser!  We have our Stingnose jigging spoons about two-feet below a Teaser-T, the in-line bucktail teaser and swivel from Thundermist.  The in-line swivel is often used to help prevent line twists, so in this case, not only will it help with that, but it will also help catch more fish! We're going to keep our Stingnose jigging spoons about a foot off of the bottom, with the Teaser-T targeting fishing that might be a bit more suspended.  Plus you can get two at a time!

Should you Trim your Leader Line after Every Fishing Trip? | Thundermist Quick Fishing Tip Hello folks. Today's quick tip is taken from this question from "Flounder Hunter: Thank you for the tip ivo, also do u cut off your flouro leader after every trip and tie up a fresh one?"  For fluorocarbon leader you don't need to cut off a section of your leader line. Unless it's nicked or frayed. Fluorocarbon fishing line does a great job at standing up to the elements.  However if you have a monofilament fishing line leader, then I would recommend trimming about 3-6 feet off at the end of each fishing day.  As always good luck and good fishin'!

Drop Shot Rigging Jigging - The T-Drop and Flexi-Jig Winning Combo Hello folks, we're out fishing saltwater again this week. Today we're fishing sunny calm waters, and using a teaser and flexi-jig combo with soft plastics to help entice these fish.  T-Drop's are available here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=62  On calmer days it helps to fish with a more finesse approach. Keeping that in mind, we're geared up with the new t-drop inline teaser rigs and put a soft plastic on it, and ended our lines with a flexi-jig, also baited with a soft plastic.  We had a slow drift, so were able to cast out pretty far. Since we were casting out and jigging, we used braided line. This helped us maintain tight control over our lines.  It was an incredible successful day, as you'll be able to see right away!

Jigging Tips for Walleye on the Rocks It's a great, but cold day out here on the water. We're rigged up with Flexi-Jigs and fishing along the rocky bottom for walleye!  What we're going to be doing today, is running a chartreuse flexi jig baited up an artificial minnow-type bait. Since there is no weed in this area, we're casting out as far as we can, and bouncing the jigs in towards the boat.  For fishing line, we're using 10lb test braided line off of a 10lb test fluorocarbon leader, on a medium heavy rod. A great combination for jigging!  The thinner braided line helps me get nice long casts in, and the medium heavy rod really helps with those hooksets.  For jigging technique, we're not jigging hard, but rather giving it a slow lift up, and a slow lift back down. This slower jigging technique I find to be more effective in the colder spring water, specifically targeting the pre-spawn bite.

Easy Carp Fishing Tips - Simple Bite Detection Tips and Huge Carp Catching Action Hello folks, on today's episode we're going to be fishing for carp. We'll be using a different set up to help with easier bite detection.  Sometime when a carp bites, you'll really know it. Although sometimes carp will have a slow bite that can be difficult to spot. This setup works for those big, obvious bites, as well as the slow not-obvious bites.  For this setup we're using a medium sized t-turn for the extra strength as it's rated up to 50 lbs. From the t-turn we go 4 inches down to the sinker, and a much longer line out to a simple hook. The bobber however, is not to keep our line suspending, as we definitely want that longer line with the hook to rest right on the bottom.  The trick is to pull your bobber high enough on your line so the sinker does not pull the bobber below the surface of the water. You'll want the bobber far enough just enough do that it can lay flat on the top of the water.   As soon as that bobber goes down... it's time to set the hook!

Fluke Fishing in Raritan Bay, NJ (Sandy Hook) Today we're out in the beautiful state of New Jersey. Even though we left our boat behind, we are not boatless as we're fishing with Captain Art of Katie James Sport Fishing out in the windy waters.  Rigged up with Cattail sinkers and cut bait on Viper Spoon, we drift along the water bottom bouncing for fluke. It was a windy and slightly rainy day, though that didn't stop any of us from landing our fair share of keeper fluke.  Due to the cloudy weather and darker stained water, we were running the gold Viper Spoons, as gold tends to have a better shine in darker waters than silver.  The Cattail Sinkers really helped keep our lines from getting snagged up on any rocky debris on the bottom.   Big special thanks to:  Katie James Sport Fishing LLC Call Captain Art at (201) 696-7592 https://www.facebook.com/pages/Katie-James-Sport-Fishing-LLC/125664934195413   If you're interested in getting your own Cattail Sinkers, you can get them here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=42  Viper Spoons are available here: http://store.thundermistlures.com/home.php?cat=52   Follow our ongoing fishing adventures Instagram: http://instagram.com/thundermistlures Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thundermistlures Twitter: http://twitter.com/thundermist Web: http://thundermistlures.com  As always until next time, good luck and good fishin'!

Boatless Angler - Top Water Striper Tips No boat? No problem! We're boatless today fishing top water on the saltwater shores looking for those striped bass.  The set up 20 lb Thunderbraid, with a 20 lb Thundercarbon leader. a single snap, and a top water lure. We're using a normal rod, though a surfcasting rod would be better as it would let us cast further out.  Today's technique is pretty simple. We're casting out as far as we can, and reeling in the top water lure as fast as we can. We don't want the striper to take a good look at the lure. But instead, want them to see the fast-paced action, drawing them into a bite.

Ice Fishing on Lake Nipissing, Ontario, Canada -   Зимняя Рыбалка в Онтарио Ice Fishing In February on Lake Nipissing  (3.5 hours away from Toronto)   We rented a place from   http://www.lakenipissingicefishingcharters.net/contact.html  They have Cabins for four, six and eight people.   They also rent out day cabins, that have the very essentials for fishing, but you can't stay overnight.    The cabin that we rented was $220 per person for 2 nights/3 days.  There is also a $50 charge for the generator if you want one to have electricity, it runs on Diesel.  (YOU DO WANT ONE).   The Cabin has no water, so make sure to bring water, keep in mind, you'll need some for cooking, drinking washing hands, etc.   There is also a day cabin that is included in this price, thus if you want to go deeper / further into the lake fishing, Derek (the manager of the property) will show you around, and guide you to the day fishing cabin.   You better be driving an SUV or something that can drive on ice, snow/ slush, etc. IF you have just a regular little car like ours :)) you can ask Derek, and he is more than happy to drive you around on the lake (your car stays on the parking lot).   There is a Foodland grocery store, LCBO and other stores in Callender, thus you don't need to go nuts shopping before you leave, you can buy pretty much all you need in that little town.   The best months for fishing according to Derek are January and March, we were out of luck :) even though our friends did catch something, but that required dedication :))   more details and what to bring in the next video ....  once its ready, I'll post a link to it here.

Amazing Kalamalka Kokanee Spawning This video is all thanks to my Dad who went down to Coldstream to check out the spawning Kokanee salmon in the creek.  Turns out they have already started to come into the streams in good numbers and there are some big fish showing up.  Some monsters for the average kokanee fisherman.  These things look more like their ocean swimming cousins the sockeye salmon rather than the land locked version.  These guys don't have far to swim to spawn though and we're hoping they have an amazing year to continue the cycle of life and keep kokanee in Beautiful Kalamalka lake for years to come.  Check out the great shots of these amazing little fish as they prepare to spawn.  Thanks for watching.

I didn't realize my parents were going to be in the are so when I found out they were today I sent them out.  They were armed with iPhones and sent it to me... hence the poor video quality.

Alberta Fisheries Management Walleye Test Net Pull Results So I didn't think it would be a big deal to make a short documentary of the Alberta Fisheries Management Test Netting in Alberta.  Turns out that I was wrong.  They did not want us to video the nets being pulled.  They stated pictures were fine, but no video.  It is too bad because I thought the biologist shared a lot of good information with us. I tried to repeat what he said in this video.  Talking with them really changed my view a lot regarding the whole activity of test netting.  They were nice, both boats called us right on over so that they could tell us what they were doing.  Sorry I had to blur most of the video to protect their identity.  I still think you get good picture of what is going on.  I know this testing seems to be a controversial subject, but I think if they were more open to the public and wouldn't try to be so secretive maybe they would be more accepted.  Or are they doing something wrong?  Tell me what you think.

Cold Lake Predators Pike Walleye Lake Trout Lake Trout, Walleye and Northern Pike were on the Cold Lake menu today.  The early morning Rains and wind didn't keep us off the lake but the fishing was sure slow.  Fish were striking short and many fish were lost early in the morning.  As the rain slowed and the ski brightened the fish became more active and we landed a few pike.  Somewhere in the mix we found one small walleye, but no others to were located this day.  We drove across the lake through a rain storm to the river in search or walleye.  The lake temperature was 40.9 degrees F as the ice had only come off the week before.  We were marking some fish and dragging bottom bouncers turned up a nice pike, a few lost fish and a small lake trout.  Talk about a tough day fishing but we did manage three predatory species and had a great day of fishing.

This is a great location to go ice fishing as they have a campground and a resort with some rustic cabins.  You can take the whole family along.

HOW TO ICE FISH EAST PIT RAINBOW TROUT How to ice fishing for East Pit Lake in Alberta, Rainbow Trout.  These  trout have a voracious appetite eating a lot of large food items in the early ice season to pack on the pounds for winter before food and oxygen supplies dwindle later in the season.  These fish were packed with large water beetles and other aquatic insects.  They weren't full though because they were very aggressive on the MarCum and would charge in and not waste any time before grabbing the spoon.  Had a great day out on the ice and if you give it a try I hope you do too!

How to Catch Pigeon Lake Walleye and Fill Tags Spring Fishing Walleye in the first week of June can sometimes be a little tricky.  With water temperatures still low the walleye are not always as active as you would expect by mid June.  The fish are still moving from their spawning areas back to prime feeding areas.  Needless to say a little hide and seek is sometimes needed to begin your walleye fishing day.  First try near prime spawning locations and fish shallower than you usually would later in the summer.  Walleye can be found in a few feet of water at this time of year around rocky shorelines, creeks or river mouths.  If you don't find activity in those locations you should head to structure where you usually find them in mid June.  Some fish will have already taken up residence off main lake points, mid lake humps, flats and so on.  But this some of year fish will really be keying in on fish holding structure since there isn't really weed growth yet to protect the bait fish from predation.  So where ever you find rocky cover for bait fish  you will probably find the Walleye.  Go for a slower presentation and sometimes tipping with a piece of minnow will work well.  If using lures I prefer mid size Cicada's by Reef Runner fished slow along the bottom or small swimbaits.  The fish will be eating small forage fish at this time of year and many times are often surviving on fresh water shrimp and may fly larva as I found in some stomach contents this spring.  So small presentations will often trigger more strikes.  Don't forget to give this a try next time you are out this spring.

Alberta Fisheries Management Test Netting for Walleye Woke up after one foggy morning and looked out onto the lake to see some bright orange flags bobbing in the distance.  We hopped in the boat and went to check them out.  Turns out Alberta Fisheries Management Biologists had been there that morning and dropped 4 test nets into the lake.  We drove around the lake and surveyed the nets.  I did some commentary, but you can tell me what you think about our biologists netting the lakes every five years.  The next morning we saw them come out and were able to talk with them on the water.  That will be in another video.  Don't miss it.  This may be a controversial post as the fisheries people didn't seem to appreciate us video taping the pull.  Not sure why they have anything to hide if they are just doing their job.

Pinehurst Lake Fall Northern Pike Fishing Fall is a great time of year to get out on the water and enjoy some shallow water pike fishing.  Since the water has cooled off the Big fish have moved up into the shallow water from their deep water haunts of the summer.  These fish are hungry and feeding heavily before the freeze.  Casting and trolling large swimbaits, crankbaits and spoons can put you into a whole bunch of fish.  Target shallow bays, rocky points, weed and reed beds for the best fall action.

Big Northern Pike Ice Fishing Pigeon Lake This is the biggest Northern Pike I have ever caught at Pigeon lake so it was pretty surprising.  Even though there is the odd giant pike in the lake they really are few and far between.  We caught quite a few pike this day and hopefully it is a good sign for the future.  It would be nice to see more big pike again one day in this lake.  They sure are fun to catch!  I think this was actually 6 pound test when I checked afterward and caught on a Jig and Minnow just when setting up the Jaw Jacker.  After watching my underwater footage I actually hooked this fish on the jaw Jacker before this but he got off.  That underwater footage to come.

Upper Kananaskis Lake is in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park of Alberta.  The lake is now being returned to its natural state and has a great population of Bull Trout and Cutthroat trout,  This was my first time fishing there and I caught a couple bull trout on a drop off near the bottom.  I later found out if you want to catch the cutthroat they are suspended high off the bottom only 15-30 feet below the ice.  This was my first time using the HD ICE TROUT lure and it performed well.  The fish were chasing it all over and eating it.  This is a beautiful place to ice fish and even if the fish aren't biting the scenery is breathtaking.

Moose Lake Alberta Walleye Fishing Our first time to Moose Lake Alberta near Bonnyville was a success!  We searched all morning but found the walleye hanging on a point with a near by weed bed.  The fish reacted very well to a Berkley Havoc swim bait that was cast up on the flat and then hopped down the drop off. The fish were hitting the lure multiple times every cast.  The fishing was fast and furious and fish ranged in size from 43- 60 cm with the odd Northern Pike thrown in for good measure.  This truly is a great lake in Alberta if you're looking to catch some beautiful walleye.  Don't take my word for it, get out there and try it for yourself.

Even though the weather could have been nicer, we had a blast, caught a ton of salmon and had the choice to keep only the best ones! My girlfriend (who gave me the trip as a birthday present) who is not much into fishing and thought about bringing a book to keep her entertained, spend the full four hours casting and enjoying fighting against the fish.  The guide was very experienced and funny! He even brought us coffee and some fish candy - what an awesome fishing trip!! As we are absolute fishing beginners and had never filet a fish before, he quickly did it for us and showed us how its done properly so we now have a freezer full of fresh delicious salmon that already made a tasty meal for us and some friends.  It was a clear 10 out of 10 points - and we will definitely come back to do the sturgeon tour in the spring! Fully recommended, beginners fishing, weekend fishing trip, salmon fishing BC - only 90min drive from Downtown Vancouver!

Sallmouth Bass fishing in New Brunswick Canada My friend and I set out for a lake we wanted to fish, on a "less than perfect" rainy day.  Regardless of the weather, we started fishing and hardly made it away from our launch and the bite was on!  For most of the day (except in the heaviest rain), we had great luck, and combined we caught over 40 fish easily ranging from 12-19 inches, most being in the 15'-17' range.  I'm sure if 17' is the average, there's at least a few lunkers in there!! This video is a small portion of some of the catches I made before my camera battery died. Hope you enjoy! :) ['Ascend FS12', 'Smallmouth Bass', 'Kayak fishing', 'New Brunswick Canada', 'Smallies']

How to Catch Spring Rainbow Trout Shannon Lake Kayak Fishing Kayak Fishing Shannon Lake in Kelowna British Columbia right after ice out.  Actually there was still some ice left on the lake, but was disappearing fast.  Launched in the afternoon and headed over to the shallow marshy area.  In spring after ice out these areas will often warm waster and aquatic insects will be more active.  Hence the fish can often be found in these areas throughout the day.  I was casting a white powerworm on a small green jig head and it seemed to do the trick.  Three bites and three hookups.  Not bad for the first time out on open water 2015.  Haven't been kayak fishing for a long time so it was great to be back on the green fishing machine.  Don't overlook kayaks as a great fishing platform.  Good Luck out there at Shannon Lake.  Shannon lake has stocked Fraser Valley Rainbows, Large Mouth Bass and Yellow Perch of sporting value.

Ice Fishing BC Ice Fishing in British Columbia with the Pemberton Fish Finder is very fun and rewarding.  Ice typically forms on the lakes toward the end of November and remains through March. Most of our ice fishing is done in Pemberton, "rather than Whistler BC" because the ice is generally better and the fish are much larger. On colder days ice huts are provided so that you can catch fish in comfort.  Ice fishing is great for all ages.  Visit our Website http://pembertonfishfinder.com for more information about Ice Fishing in British Columbia, Canada and don't forget to subscribe;)  Buy all of the Fishing products you see in this video online http://store.spudvalley.com/index.php ['Ice Fishing', 'BC', 'British Columbia', 'Ice Fishing Video', 'Canada', 'Ice Fishing In Whistler', 'Ice', 'Fishing', 'in', 'Pemberton']
High Pressure Cold Front Ice Fishing - The Struggle is Real This last year my borther came up from Montana while we were in Alberta.   We had hopes of great ice fishing, but Mother Nature had different plans.  The somewhat warm weather the week prior turned to frigid cold with Daytime temps from -25 to -30 degrees C.  While I often have good luck in cold temps, this time combined with the high pressure system and sliver moon phase just seemed to put the fish into hiding.  This didn't stop us from working as hard as we could to put fish on the ice.  With several missed fish and one decent pike lost we were somewhat disappointed.  Then the sun started to set and a few small walleye came in to save the day.  The Struggle is Real but a day on the ice is better than any day at work.

GoPro underwater video of Cisco Herring ice fishing on Lake Simcoe. GoPro underwater video of Cisco Herring ice fishing on Lake Simcoe. This is the first video where we were able to record the action using two cameras. We have just purchased a GoPro Hero and made it nice and wet, let it go down about 20 feet, where the action was. It is awesome to see how Cisco Herring behave, when you use a jig that looks like a small, wounded fish and make it dance in front of them. Some of them attacked in from more than forty feet away, just like a torpedo. They reminded me of barracudas and sharks, the way they circled the lure. You can also see some great catch and release footage to encourage anglers to practice conservation.

Northern Pike Fishing , 45" 1/2inch Fish Filming with GoPro Hero 3 while guiding this summer in Northwest Territories. Two of my guests had more then 10 trophy fish each during their stay at Taltson Bay Big Pike Lodge. July 13th and Randy hooked into this beauty 45"1/2in Trophy Northern. The current was swift and landing this fishing without a dip net made this task quite tricky without losing this fish of the day!! But with many years of experience and some luck I managed. That day was hot, high 20's degrees and the water was very cool in the river, so there were big fish hanging in the eddies and near shore where there were plenty of cabbage. Grinders and johnsons did the trick for luring them big girls in.

Fishing Lac Seul, Ontario - 45 inch Nothern Pike 45 inch northern pike caught in late May while fishing for walleye using 8 lb test line and 1/4 oz. jig tipped with a salted minnow. Out of the water and back in as quickly as possible - she looked to be in good shape as she swam away. Biggest northern I've ever caught in 30 years on Lac Seul.  Thanks to Steve E. for the use of his boat and net.  The boat was good, but the net was about half as big as it needed to be.  Caught on a two week houseboat trip with Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges.

There is plenty of room to walk around and stretch.  Being inside an ice hut blocks out all of the daylight allowing you to look into the lake and see fish strike your fishing lures. Pretty neat!

How to Tip Up Fishing Big Northern Pike Fishing in Alberta for Northern Pike with Windlass Tip-Up.  At first I tried a standard hot spot on a shallow flat about 5 to 8 feet of water near a large reed bed.  The area was littered with small pike in the 2-5 pound range pulling on my baits every few minutes so I got out of that area.  Moved to another area off a rocky point with a sharp break in about 10 feet of water and had a couple nice pike come through.

52" Musky Lake of the Woods 2012 Giant Quest Lac Seul Turbo This fish really was a dream come true for Heinrich.  The summer was flying by and a busy walleye guiding schedule for Heinrich and musky guiding gig for Mike didn't leave much time to film together.  Mike fished the area 2 days previous and lost a huge fish on a walk the dog bait. A buddy of ours also landed a 49 1/4" Musky on a Walk the Dog bait with Mike. The weather leading up to this day was typical of the dog days of summer, hot and calm.  We woke up to blowing wind and it was tough to get up and get motivated.  We knew big fish were holding in the area, but we struggled to tackle the 25-30mph winds and opted to fish out of the wind as much as possible.  We only moved one 40" class fish earlier in the day on Dadson Blade Bait.  After we caught the 52" Musky, we continued to fish right into the night.  At dark we switched the camera off and Mike had another GIANT hit on his walk the dog bait at the same spot he lost one two nights earlier.  It was only a few hundred yards from where we caught the first Giant earlier in the day. It got off again, but at least we got the 52" earlier in the day.  Thanks to Dadson Blade Baits and American Hardwood for the baits and continued support.

Edna Lake Merritt BC Brook Trout Ice Fishing Ice Fishing Edna Lake near Merritt BC for Brook Trout.  This was my first time to the lake and thought I would give it a try since it is a small lake that is stocked with 8000 brook trout a year.  Supposedly some get to large sizes as well.  Although I only caught this years stocked trout and I suspect this lake may have winter killed in 2014.  Maybe someone else knows for sure.  Anyways it was a very early morning bite near the pump house and then they vanished.  It was a beautiful day though and fun while it lasted.  Hope you enjoy this micro trout video.

Great River Fishing: Group of Anglers Catch a White Sturgeon on the Fraser River Fishing http://greatriverfishing.com - On Friday, September 21, a group of 30 anglers from a Kamloops accounting firm caught a 1000 pound sturgeon. The group was on a team building fishing trip with Great River Fishing Adventures on the Fraser River near Chilliwack.  The firm's owner Norman Daley hooked the monster fish which weighed five times more than him.  The sturgeon was 11 feet eight inches long and had a massive five foot girth tape measured below the pectoral fins. Although impossible to weigh fish in the river based on its measurements charts indicate that the sturgeon caught would weigh about 1,000+ pounds.

Channel Catfish and Bullhead - Master fishing at Lockport Mb Catching some amazing Channel Catfish and Brown Bullhead's at Lockport Mb! I spent the first evening and entire next day, just learning how to catch fish here and watching as others caught fish around me, and don't worry I learned how as well and I tell all my tips and tricks in the video! I was surprised on the amount of pulling force these channel catfish have to offer, and the fight was truly memorable; and I now highly recommend giving these fish a try! In total I caught 9 fish; 8 of which were captured on film in this video, and of those 8, 5 are Manitoba Master Angler Fish! My goal was to catch my first Manitoba Master Angler! A plain and simple dream I know; but I couldn't imagine I would catch 5! I'm definitely going to be back here trying this spot out again! The thing about accomplishing a goal or dream; is being able to create new goals and dreams! I definitely want to catch, 2 more master cats and 3 more master bullheads for my Manitoba master angler specialty badges! While filming this video, I was watched as others fished for different species of fish in this area. I looked on, as numerous goldeye's, carp and freshwater drum's were being caught! I'm going to have to try for drums and goldeye here in the future! And I truely do believe I should be able to capture at least 5 master goldeye at this location.

Take your Kids Salmon fishing in British Columbia Salmon fishing in British Columbia.  Anytime we can get kids to put down their Xbox's and pick up a tackle box, we are winning.  At the Pemberton Fish Finder we make parents hero's daily.  Teach your kids a life skill that they will have and enjoy in there own backyard.  Our fishing guides will teach your children simple fish handling and fishing techniques that will have them on the fast track to success.  Simple things such as; reading water, lure selection, gear selection and casting instruction are provided on each and every tour.  Instruction that they can perfect over their lifetime of enjoying the outdoors. At the Pemberton Fish Finder we take pride in providing a Safe, fun, educational and rewarding fishing adventure for all ages and abilities.  We have yet to find a child that does not enjoy fishing, especially when it comes to Salmon fishing.  The rivers surrounding Whistler, BC at points are so full of Salmon that they will be bumping up against your legs while fishing.  This makes it hard to not catch, at this point we refer to fishing as "catching".  Parents also love to get in on some of the action because their child's excitement is very infectious.  Seriously, how does one not enjoy fishing when you are catching fish? It's never too early to get your kids outside enjoying the outdoors.  As long as they are strong enough physically to hold on to the rod, keep the tip up and reel at the same time, they are old enough to go fishing.  Most kids reach fishing maturity between ages 6 - 10.  Myself, my children have been enjoying the outdoors since they were old enough to walk.  Below I have included a very exciting video of a young boy and his first Salmon.  Our guide "Scott" walks him through the whole experience and shows him proper fish handling techniques.  The Salmon at the end of the video swims off unharmed to continue it's journey.  To book a memorable fishing experience with your children, call the Pemberton Fish Finder toll free (877)905-8121 or email info@pembertonfishfinder.com Rates and other fishing adventures we offer are on our website.  We look forward to fishing with you, Pemberton Fish Finder.  https://pembertonfishfinder.com ['salmon fishing', 'Whistler fishing', 'salmon fishing guides', 'salmon fishing in BC', 'Salmon fishing in Canada', 'Kids fishing lessons', 'Kids fishing', 'fun fishing', 'Pemberton Fish Finder', 'how to catch Salmon', 'fishing adventures', 'fishing trips', 'Sockeye Salmon', 'fun things to do in Whistler', 'Fun things to do in British Columbia', 'Fun things to do in Canada', 'Canada Fishing trips', 'BC Fishing Trips']

Big Chinook Salmon Fisherman Back Flips Into Ocean My Brother Tyson is slightly... and by slightly I mean a lot less interested if fishing than me.  But he still enjoys coming along in hopes of getting the big one.  He has been on two trips with me in the last year and jumped at the opportunity at our last minute Ucluelet British Columbia trip last week.  Despite being riddled with engine troubles and Expedia cancelled reservations we still made out all Right.  We were out fishing on South Bank with out 9.9 hp Mercury four stroke when something hit at 127 feet on the rigger on a Green and Glow Kingfisher Spoon by Silver Horde.  My brother grabbed the rod and the fish starts pulling drag and reels a screaming.  Pulled out the camera and well the rest is history.  I think he was a little excited about this one.  What do you think.  Please leave your comments, suggestions and questions for furture videos!

Walleye and Smallmouth Bass on Bomber Model 8A Crankbait Bomber Model A 3" 1/2oz → http://amzn.to/2dL91xZ Finally got out fishing this year on the Super Hawk!  We got out right before dusk for a few hours, it was a blast, it was cool to see the super moon that night along with the sun setting, I tell you what there's nothing more beautiful than a sunset out on Lake St. Clair.  We got a double dose of pleasure that night from the great outdoors.    Anyways, let's get down to business, I was trolling for muskie and northern pike, interchanging between a bucktail spinner and a big muskie crankbait on the left side.  While my friend on the right was trolling a Bomber Model 8A crankbait, the fishing lure has a yellowish belly with a brown top and brown scales.  I bought this crankbait about two years ago from either Bass Pro or Lakeside Fishing Shop, anyways I looked online and can't seem to find the color anymore.  I hate when Bomber discontinues a color.   I didn't get any hits on my line, but my friend caught a nice walleye and a few smallmouth bass.  I might of been embellishing each catch, but it's been a long time since I've been out fishing. My friend usually doesn't catch anything when he goes out, so this was quite the fishing expedition for him as well.  Later that night, he said he caught more fish that day than he has in his whole life.  There's no doubt the trolling gives you better odds for catching fish.  I was just hoping that we could land a lunker, but I was happy that we just caught some beautiful fish from Lake St. Clair.  My previous fishing videos I've been recording with the Go Pro HD Hero, much recently I bought a Go Pro Hero 2.  So far I'm pleased with it!  It would've been nice to buy the Go Pro 3, but the company is having some problems with it.  And I really don't like the dark tint that I see in some of the Go Pro 3 videos, they must of added a filter to the lens.  Some bloggers suggest the company rushed the Go Pro 3 camera onto the market, obviously to make more money.  So that's whyI bought the Go Pro Hero 2, I needed a very dependable POV camera.  I'm not one of those people who cares about a little better definition in my videos.  Since the Go Pro 2 has a mic input, I ordered up a Sony ECM-DS70P microphone off Amazon, not the bootleg ones that are being sold on eBay.  Along with a reasonably priced windscreen from eBay.  Hopefully the windscreen works well or I'm sending it back.  Because I am so tired of hearing the wind distortion in my fishing videos.  So I'm praying to the fish Gods that this windscreen blocks the wind out on the lake.  I used Sony Vegas 12 to edit the video.  The end result from the conversion and upload is not that bad, but doesn't do the camera justice.  The Go Pro footage looks amazing before it runs through conversion software.  If your computer and Internet can handle it, click on the YouTube button on the video that upgrades it to 1080p, it looks pretty good!  But it looks better before the upload.  We had a lot of glare out on the lake that day due to the sunset.  Anyways I'm pretty pleased with the end result and happy I picked up a new Go Pro camera.  Just can't wait to get out on the water again!  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Fishing Tackle ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  LURE: • Bomber Model A 3" 1/2oz → http://amzn.to/2dL91xZ  ROD:  • Ugly Stik Elite Spinning 6' Medium → http://amzn.to/2edQkSR  REEL:  • Shimano Sienna 2500RD → http://amzn.to/2duWNEj  LINE:  • 10lb Berkley Trilene XT Monofilament → http://amzn.to/2edSguu  CAMERA:  • GoPro HD Hero2 Camera→ http://amzn.to/2el56ST  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ About Eternal Angler ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  A great spot on the web where you can find me fishing at some of my favorite lakes in Michigan.

Had a great surprise though as my Jaw Jacker went off and the fish started pealing drag.

My first brown trout through the ice.  Outfished by the Jaw Jacker again.  Caught on a small olive scud.  Caught and released to enjoy another day.

How to Fishing - Shore Jigging BC Rockfish Salmon fishing was getting boring so went in search of near shore Rockfish.  This technique worked well in California for rockfish and I couldn't see why it wouldn't in Canada.  So I gave it a try and it worked amazing.  Jigging near shore off a rocky drop with a Big Hammer Swim Bait.  The Rockfish were nearly jumping in the boat.  All were Copper Rockfish, looks like a healthy population in this area.  Had a few for the ice chest and lots to catch and release.  So much fun catching these aggressive fish.  Now that I know they are around I'll have to take along a bait casting rod next time and have some fun.  I know my kids aren't wearing life jackets, it is not the law in Canada and please don't follow my example.  They do wear life jackets when we think necessary.  Sorry, since I know I'll be hearing about it.

30+ inch walleye, Lake of the Woods, Opener A quick video of a big 30+ inch walleye caught on the 2013 fishing opener on Lake of the Woods, Canada. The walleye hit as we swept in for a shallow pass through a south facing bay that was wind protected and had some rubble shore that transitioned to a sandy beach. It was caught on a bottom bouncer pulling a spinner rig topped with minnow in 6 feet of water. The shock and awe factor is priceless as you hear the word vomit that Tony produces as this is his biggest walleye to date. Hope you enjoy the video! A "Like" would be greatly appreciated!

How to Catch Battle Lake Alberta Walleye Went out fishing for the first time on Battle Lake Alberta Canada for Walleye and Pike.  Took the family along for a few hours on the lake one beautiful afternoon.  The water was high but the launch was still difficult to navigate.  Had to sink the truck basically to get the boat off of the trailer.  Just a warning of caution to those with larger boats.  Once on the water though the fish could be seen swimming along the bottom in the clear waters of this lake.  The pike fishing for hammer handle size pike was one after another.  If you were able to keep it away from them you also had a chance at catching one of the beautiful walleye in this lake.  A great few hours was had by all.  The biggest pike was 70 cm, but very skinny and went home for dinner.  The swimbait that was used was a Big Hammer 3 inch tipped with a minnow tail.  Sorry for the background noise and babies... that won't last long and I'll miss it more than you when it is gone!  You'll be seeing my fishing girls a lot more as they grow up on me.

Fishing the North Saskatchewan River for Sturgeon and Walleye The North Saskatchewan river is listed as the 12th longest river in Canada flowing some 1,287 kilometers where, after connecting with the South Saskatchewan river, it eventually flows into Lake Winnipeg.   It is also home to a multitude of fish species, with roughly a dozen different species that can be caught within the Edmonton city limits.   Depending on whom you ask one of the most coveted and perhaps most challenging fish to have at the end of your fishing rod is the Lake Sturgeon.  I joined Dr. Todd Zimmerling President and CEO of the Alberta Conservation Association and Nick Porayko of Lunkers Fishing Adventures for a day out on this remarkable river.

Lac La Biche Fat Walleye Fishing Alberta Have been hearing stellar reports from Lac La Biche Lake in Alberta regarding big walleye being caught.  I figured it was time we go take a look for ourselves and see what all the fuss was about.  Well we weren't disappointed but we didn't catch any as big as some people were leading us to believe.  I have a suspicion that people are over estimating there catches weight as these 4 to 6 pound walleye are so fat and look big.  Would be misleading to the angler who has never caught a large walleye before.  We had steady action all day fishing crankbaits and bottom bouncers in different areas of the lake near sharp drop offs.  We will be back.  www.flixpress.com was use to make the title in this video.

North to Nemeiben Almost every long weekend in May during the 1990s, a group of CBC employees from Regina, Saskatchewan would head north to Nemeiben Lake to go fishing.  They were led by Aron Bergren who had spent many years guiding in the northern lakes.  Aron knew every rock hazard and all the best fishing holes and, as a result, provided the best fishing experience any of these happy hookers would ever have.  His only fee: he got to keep all the pickerel cheeks for himself.  Aron passed away on January 1, 2011.  I have uploaded this short film (which I made in 1992) in memory of Aron and the great times we all had on Nemeiben Lake.  Enjoy!

Remote Fly Fishing Trips in Whistler British Columbia Canada Remote Fly Fishing Trips in Whistler British Columbia Canada.  The Alpine lakes surrounding Whistler and Pemberton, British Columbia Canada are absolutely full of Rainbow Trout that seldom see hooks.  This makes them eager to bit your hooks, no matter how poorly they are presented.  These remote alpine lake are only ice free a maximum of 6 months of the year.  As you can see in both the pictures and video, snow rarely leaves the mountain tops.  The mountains surrounding our Alpine lakes reach as high as 8500 ft in elevation and most of the Alpine lakes that we fish sit at 5500 ft or less.  The air has a hint of alpine flowers and lush forests.  It is so peaceful and quiet that you can actually hear yourself think.  In every direction there are stunning views and the fishing is fabulous.  There is something said about cooking your catch over an open fire and tasting the freshness.  There is no need for salt, pepper, spices or rubs, the hint of smoke completes the delicate flavor of the trout.  A cooler full of cold beverages and salads definitely adds to lunch.  Although the fish appear burnt in the picture, the skin and bones both peel away leaving only delicious, perfectly cooked meat behind.  In the remote alpine lakes that we fish the Rainbow trout range in size from 12" - 25" and can weigh as much as 5 LBS.  Trout are abundant making these remote lakes a great place for first timers to learn how to fly  fish.  Come out and experience some of the best fly fishing in the World.  The Helicopter flight in to the Remote fly fishing lakes in Whistler British Columbia Canada is simply stunning.  In every direction there are snow covered peaks and lush green forests below.  We typically fly over numerous creeks, lakes and view glaciers.  On occasion we view wildlife from the helicopter that include; Mountain Goat, Black Bear and Mule deer.  Once on land we view numerous song birds, Osprey and Bald Eagles.

Fly Fishing BC 2013 Using data from Enbridge's own reports, the Polaris Institute calculated that 804 spills occurred on Enbridge pipelines between 1999 and 2010. These spills released approximately 161,475 barrels (25,672.5 m3) of crude oil into the environment. (source: read more at wikipedia)  The vast majority of spills have occurred on flat land and in the midwest. Imagine how much worse it will be in the dynamic, rugged mountain terrain of BC.

Pink Salmon Fly Fishing Tours Squamish British Columbia Canada Pink Salmon Fishing Tours Squamish British Columbia Canada.  When Fly Fishing for Pink Salmon in Squamish on the Squamish River.  Use either a sinking tip or floating fly Line.  If you are using a sink tip fly line use flies that are not heavily weighted or you will find the bottom regularly.  With the Sinking tip fly line you will be using a shorter fly line leader with a max length of 9'.  I typically use a leader length of around 6' with a breaking strength of 12 LBS.  While using a dry line you will definitely want to use a Pink Salmon Fly Pattern that has a bit of weight to it either by means of a bead head or adding weight to the body of the fly.  Split shot at the head of the fly is a cheap alternative.  With a floating fly line you will want to use a leader length between 9' - 12' with a breaking strength of 12 LBS.  You do not need to cast far to catch Pink Salmon in the Squamish River or the Mamquam River.  You will find that most of the Pink Salmon that you will catch will be in Knee deep water.  The reason for this is that Pink Salmon typically make their way up the Rivers along the path of least resistance.  The shoreline provides the path of least resistance.  Below are a couple pictures of popular Pink Salmon fly patterns for both a dry line and a sinking line.  All of these patterns and fly fishing supplies are available at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd. in Pemberton, BC at 1380 Birch Street.  Right now they have a Pink Salmon Fly Rod combo that includes a fly reel, fly line, fly leader, backing and a quality 9 foot 8 weight fly rod for only $99.  Let the boys at Spud Valley Sporting Goods ltd gear you up and give you the low down on how to catch them.

Steelhead Tour 2010 - Fishing Diaries - Skeena River My friends Steve and Jeff join me on a trip to central BC to fish for steelhead on the Skeena River near Terrace. we have been calling it Tackle-box tour for 4 years now but we are fly guys so steelhead tour is a more appropriate title i guess. we fish all day, drink all night and sometimes get into a LAM or two (Large Adult Male). its basically the best trip for guys like us because the land is so great up there and there are so few people.  the deal was if we didn't catch a steelhead we had to listen to our most hated band, Nickleback. in out eyes its a horible punishment.

He explained why he has been coming back to Newfoundland and Labrador every year since the late 60s to fish salmon. I will have to go back for another flick later in the season.

Die DVD ist ab sofort erhältlich bei NATURE VISION (http://www.nature-vision.de).  Weitere Infos: http://www.canada-flyfishing.com  Bis zu 100 Pfund schwer wird dieser Gigant. Er ist der King unter den pazifischen Lachsen - der Königslachs. Unbändig tobt der Fisch an der Angelrute, reißt oft hunderte Meter Schnur von der Rolle und kann kaum gestoppt werden. Und nicht selten zieht der Angler den Kürzeren. Wer zum ersten Mal einen King drillt, ist einfach nur sprachlos. Was für eine Kraft und Schnelligkeit. Die Angelmethoden auf diesen Riesen sind vielfältig. Vom aktiven Fliegen- und Spinnfischen bis hin zur gemütlicheren Art des Fischens - dem Ansitzangeln.

Crabbing with 2 Reel Fishing Adventures When you book a fishing charter with 2 Reel Fishing Adventures in Sooke, BC, you also get to drop 2-3 crab traps, right in Sooke Harbour, on your way out for your full day or half day fishing charter.    This day we dropped 3 crab traps which produced 6 Dungeness Crab and 1 Red Rock Crab, all keepers.     This is a HUGE bonus as crab this good can be expensive. What a feast we had that night.     Salmon and crabs. Yum!

swarmed by little fish!! underwater at Kalamalka Lake, Vernon BC Kalamalka Lake has some big trout in it, usually they are caught in the cold winter months when they rise close to the surface to feed on bait-fish.  I don't think that 20 - 30+ pound trout feed on little shiners, probably they eat kokanee, but the smaller trout and kokanee eat shiners...all part of the food chain.  It's cool to see inside our local fresh water lakes and see what lurks below the surface.   Sony HDR XR550  made for a man, but easy enough for a woman to use. lol  Underwater video by Cindy.

REO Rafting - Sturgeon Fishing Fraser River BC REO and the Boothroyd First Nations offer an exciting adventure: fishing trips and charters for giant white sturgeon on the Fraser River.  http://www.reorafting.com/site/club_reo_vacations/sturgeon_fishing.html    This amazing trip includes a 17 km float trip on the mighty Fraser River upstream of the wild canyon section. This river section is Class 1 with no significant rapids, but is a beautiful float trip. We will float the Fraser to our special fishing beaches that can only be reached through Boothroyd land. Here we will meet our native guides who will set us up for sturgeon fishing.    On a recent trip, we caught and released three sturgeons in just two hours of fishing. The largest fish was about 3.5 feet in length, weighed in at 40 pounds, and took about 15 minutes to reel in. The largest sturgeon fish ever caught from the eddies and pools above the Fraser River Canyon was 6 feet in length and took over an hour to land!    http://www.reorafting.com/site/club_reo_vacations/sturgeon_fishing.html ['Rafting', 'Sturgeon', 'River', 'Canada', 'British', 'Columbia', 'BC', 'Fishing', 'Fish', 'Vancouver', 'Seattle', 'Whistler', 'Fraser']

wigwam and kishkutena muskie fishing Saturday and Sunday October 9-10, 2010. From Nestor Falls, we went across Kakabikitchewan lake up the river to Pine Lake, then up the river to Wigwam Lake, which involves two portages around waterfalls. We fished Wigwam on Saturday and caught six muskies in there. This is the third time we have fished WIgwam. Good numbers of muskies but nothing big. I think the largest we have caught out of there is 36 inches. We caught two 35's that day. On the way back down that evening, we left the boat above the first waterfall and used the Ranger to get back to camp. The next morning we took the Ranger back up river as far as the first waterfall again. We then went across the portage again into Wigwam and then upstream about 2 1/2 miles more, which included portaging around two rapids, and pulling the boat over a huge beaver dam. It took the better part of three hours before we arrived at Lake Kishkutena, plus a lot of sweat and backbreaking work carrying boat, motor, etc. I had heard of people going in there before but I would not recommend it for a day trip! Plus it is pretty trecherous, and if you broke a leg or something, I am not sure how loing it would be before someone found you... or what's left of you. Kishkutena is a fly-in lake but we got in there without paying a pilot! On the way back down, we put the motor up and shot the rapids with the canoe paddles. One time we got turned sideways and the rushing current got a little dicey I thought we might swamp and lose all our stuff, but we made it through. By shooting the rapids we only had two portages (the waterfalls) instead of four. We only caught the 41-incher in Kishkutena, but it was worth it for Dawson to catch his best muskie so far. We did see a LOT of fish, probably about a dozen that day. They were following but not biting. We got back to Wigwam in time to try a couple trolling passes and caught a 28-incher and lost a 32 right at boatside. We were back out to the camp at dark and had a long drive home that night. Quite an adventure on a spur of the moment trip. We decided to do it on Thursday night and left on Friday morning.

How to Ice Fish a New Lake: Floatingstone Lake GoPro Hero 3+ Black CATCH MORE FISH GUARANTEED WITH MARCUM TECHNOLOGY.  Went out one morning to Floatingstone lake since I was reading on iFishAlberta the summer fishing has been very good for pike and walleye with the closure.  I went out to see what could be caught.  Approaching a new body of water can be tough, but I studied the depth charts, tried by the iceshacks, and off some points with drop offs.  Turns out I didn't have a fabulous morning, but it wasn't awful.  Caught a walleye at first light a few pike and some micro perch.  Not sure if there are many good sized perch in there.  Good luck if you head out just remember there is a bait ban (maggots meal worms only) and a 0 keep limit for pike and walleye.  Got a nice shot of a pike sitting on the bottom below my hole with a GoPro Hero.

SOCKEYE SALMON - underwater [HD] Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), also called red salmon or blueback salmon, is an anadromous species of salmon found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and rivers discharging into it. There are also completely landlocked populations of the same species, which are known as the kokanee. Sockeye salmon is the third most common Pacific salmon species, after pink and chum salmon.The name "sockeye" is believed to be a folk adaptation of the anglicization of sθə́qəy̓, its name in Halkomelem, the language of the indigenous people along the lower reaches of the Fraser River. Sockeye salmon ranges as far south as the Columbia River in the eastern Pacific (though individuals have been spotted as far south as the 10 Mile River on the Mendocino Coast of California) and northern Hokkaidō Island in Japan in the western Pacific, and as far north as Bathurst Inlet in the Canadian Arctic in the east and the Anadyr River in Siberia in the west. Landlocked populations occur in the Yukon Territory and British Columbia in Canada, and in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, New York, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming in the United States. Nantahala Lake is the only spot in North Carolina where kokanee salmon are found. Sockeye are blue tinged with silver in color while living in the ocean. Just prior to spawning both sexes turn red with green heads and sport a dark stripe on their sides. Males develop a hump on their back and the jaws and teeth become hooked during their move from salt to fresh water. Sockeye spawn mostly in streams having lakes in their watershed. The young fish, known as fry, spend up to three years in the freshwater lake before migrating to the ocean. Some stay in the lake and do not migrate. Migratory fish spend from one to four years in salt water, and thus are four to six years old when they return to spawn one summer (July-August). Navigation to the home river is thought to be done using the characteristic smell of the stream, and possibly the sun. Some fish spend as long as four years in fresh water lakes before migrating. In rivers without lakes, many of the young move to the ocean soon after hatching. These salmon mature after one to four years in the ocean. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockeye_salmon Music: 'Lost Souls' by Ensams  http://www.looperman.com/tracks_detail.php?tid=65360 ['Season', 'of', 'the', 'RED', 'blueback', 'SALMON', 'Sockeye', 'salmon', 'pairs', 'runs', 'Oncorhynchus', 'nerka', 'food', 'fish', 'Kokanee', 'Trepanier', 'creek', 'spawning', 'migration', 'bed', 'channel', 'river', 'stream', 'land', 'locked', 'fishing', 'life', 'cycle', 'roe', 'eggs', 'milt', 'alevin', 'fingerlings', 'predators', 'doe', 'buck', 'Okanagan', 'lake', 'Salmon', 'Fraser', 'Adams', 'River', 'Conservation', 'streams', 'Fisheries', 'endangered', 'species', 'last', 'minute', 'cheap', 'vacation', 'package', 'tours', 'Resorts', 'Shuswap', 'Lake', 'HELLOBC', 'JCVdude', 'tourism', 'SONY', 'HD', '1080i', 'HDR', 'XR550', 'underwater', 'nature', 'wildlife', 'videography', 'Kelowna', 'BC']

If you enjoy this travel back in time be sure to give this video a thumbs up.  Highlights from the day than did  not make it onto the film were the most fish caught with a single cast.  I believe it was Wayne that caught one pike that had been feeding on minnows.  I believe Brenda caught two with a single cast.  I can't remember whether her fish had eaten a small pike, pickerel or perch, but it was a rather substantial dinner. . . and yet these fish still could not resist dinning on an old fashioned red & white.

Lying sideways after a long fight, the body of the fish entirely covered the bottom of the 8" drilled hole.

We rented the house from Steve Pappenfus and Tom Kuehl of Up North Sleepers. Their contact number is 320-309-7992 and their website is www.upnorthsleepers.us.

Gord Pyzer Shares Winter Sonar Secrets Watch how easy it is to solve your winter sonar ice fishing woes once and for all!  One of the most positive changes in the winter ice fishing scene over the past few years has been the proliferation of heated huts and shelters.    Everything from the lap-of-luxury ice bungalows, like the ones you can rent on Lake Nipissing and Lake Temagami, where you eat, sleep and fish out on the ice to the more modest ice fishing shelters that you can rent on any number of lakes throughout Northeastern Ontario: https://goo.gl/54nPdH     Many winter ice anglers also prefer the joy and freedom they get by hitching up their portable shelters to their snowmachines and ATVs and exploring the thousands of pristine waterways via the elaborate system of carefully groomed trails that criss-cross the region.  Unfortunately, however, while all good things don't have to come to an end, ice huts and shelters do come with their unique set of issues.  Not the least of which is the interference that ice anglers get on their sonar units when they fish in holes only a few feet apart.  If you count yourself among the legion of ice anglers who pull out their hair and mutter under their breath while they try to tune out the unwanted sonar noise, have I got a trick for you.

Wolf Lake Northern Pike Ice fishing with Windlass Tip-Ups Wolf Lake Fishing for Water Wolves.  We had a super heavy snow year, there was 4 feet of snow in the bush around the lake.  If it weren't for the warm weather and 100 km winds a few days before I don't think we would have got on the lake.  A trapper had made one rutted trail across the lake to his cabin.  Couldn't get out to the spot I had fished before years ago.  So we headed back to a point adjacent a shallow flat dropping into the North lake basin.  Only managed one larger pike, not huge but fun to catch.  Northern Pike were biting great and had flags going constantly, two three at a time.  Great size range of fish in this lake.  All fish caught on Windlass tip ups with quick strike rigs.  Also was fishing with my 2 year old daughter who tried to catch some and got one with the help of mom.

Giant Pacific Octopus - caught on a fishing line Caught in the Haro Straight just off Victoria, Vancouver Island, British Columbia.  Sonar gave a depth of about 170' - 180'.  We thought our line was snagged on the bottom so drove the boat forward until it came loose.  When we reeled the line back in this is what we discovered.  The octopus actually clung to the underside of the boat until we pulled the hook free and it dove back into the murky depths.

Not To Many! (Smallie Fishing) Hello and welcome to another video. Here i am fishing on Long Lake for some small-mouth bass. Enjoy the video and make sure to subscribe.  Tackle setup- Rod- Quantum Strike Reel- Abu-Garcia Cardinal STX Bait- Set the hook 5" Garlic senko and Lunker Hunt Enginee Fire 5" Senko  Weather Conditions- Very choppy water with temperatures ranging from 18-25 degrees Celsius. The clouds looked fairy daring for most of the day with little bits of rain through out the day but cleared up by late afternoon.    Where the fish were caught?

Fresh From The Deep: film of BC's halibut fishery in 1922 Produced by the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau under the personal supervision of Raymond S. Peck  In the early 20s the BC halibut fishery brought in 30,000,000 pounds of fish for a value of $4,000,000  Exhibits and Publicity Bureau, Department of Trade and Commerce Fisheries...   "Seeing Canada" series  This film shows the fishing and packing of halibut in British Columbia. An animated map shows the fishing grounds along the coast of British Columbia and Alaska. In southern waters, halibut fishing is done by small vessels that cast lines about four miles long. Fishermen are shown preparing and casting these lines and then hauling in the catch. Once caught, the fish are cleaned and packed in ice in the ship's hold. In northern waters, the fishing is done by small, independently operated boats. The fishermen on these boats haul in their catch by hand and are then picked up by a "mother ship". The large plants at Prince Rupert process and pack the halibut, for distribution to the rest of the continent. Workers are shown lifting the halibut out of a ship's hold, packing the fish into crates with ice and then loading it into a railroad refrigerator car. The "Fish Express" carries the daily supply of halibut to consumers in Eastern Canada and the United States.  This film is from the "Seeing Canada" series, which was produced by Bernard E. Norrish beginning in February 1919. The "Seeing Canada" series was the first major series of films about Canada. The films were successful in showcasing Canada to an international audience and were critically acclaimed for their technical quality.  Reference Morris, Peter.

Backcountry 2011 - Severn River Conservation Reserve Canoe Route A canoe trip to the Severn River Provincial Conservation Reserve near Bala, Ontario completed in August of 2011. We parked at the Nine Mile Lake Marina and paddled down the Upper portion of the Gibson River into Woodland Lake and then Brotherson's lake where we camped for the night. We returned via portages to Turtle Lake and back to Nine Mile Lake. The Upper Gibson is very shallow and narrow in parts with rougher portages and this gets one away from the crowds that accompany many Muskoka canoe routes.   Watch in HD!

Pas la plus grosse prise du lac mais un moment agreable avec les huards. (ce poisson m a d ailleur pris par suprise en plein moment de relaxation ;) ) Les truites sont tres delicates avec les morsures elles ne mange que le bout du vers, c'est pourquoi il est preferable de les laisser un peu y gouter et revenir pour ne pas ferrer dans le vide.

Catching a MONSTER 51 inch Northern Pike (that was probably a muskie) This is a video of me catching the fish of my life with the help of my friend Sam.    It was caught in the east end of Lost Bay on Eagle Lake on 18 lb braid with a silver 6 inch Big Doctor spoon.  We didn't weigh it, but it measured 51 inches long.   The internet community seems to think it was a muskie, which I'm certainly willing to believe. It was my first time fishing Canada, and I'm definitely not an expert. It was still the biggest fish I'm ever likely to catch, ever. And only then because Sam dove in the water to grab it!    Skip to ~4:30 for the crazy part.  If we didn't get it on video I don't think anyone would believe the story.    A big thanks to everyone at Eagle Lake Island Lodge.  The accommodations were outstanding and I had the time of my life.  I cannot wait to go back.    http://www.eaglelakeislandlodge.ca/ ['fish', 'fishing', 'northern pike', 'canada', 'baitcaster', 'eagle lake', 'big', 'huge', 'monster']

I remember the day was extremely cold, but the bite was hot.  Our guide, Bonner Daniels, put us on fish time and again.  Due to the fishing pressure the bite started to die off, but Bonner adjusted and we rounded out our limit.  This was the first steelhead for most on board.

HD Sea Kayak Fishing Footage of catching, cleaning, and cooking a number of salmon over the course of a summer.   I'm certainly not an expert... but I do enjoy it.    Catching a salmon from a sea kayak is an incredible experience.   You feel every wave, every tug on the line.  It can be tireing; it can be exilerating.   Paddling into off-shore rock gardens at first light... cruising along empty shorelines.    Primarily, I use a Shimano trolling reel, on a shortened, stiff rod.  It is also possible to use a simple handline (fishing line wrapped around a stick).   Since most of my fishing is done while on multi-day trips, I am generally using artificial lures (hoochies or buzz bombs).     Please, respect the fish.  Follow local fishing guidelines.  Buy a fishing license.  Catch only what you can eat.     Liam McNeil is a proffessional sea kayak guide, based out of Tofino, British Columbia.

Algonquin Spring Trout Fishing   Day 3   Ralph Bice Lake to Little Trout Lake You can find the written trip report along with a lot more pictures at: http://www.loonislandoutdoors.com/TripReports/RalphBice/RalphBiceLake.php  After a fairly miserable day on Friday, it was really good to see the smiles and hear the laughs on day 3 of our spring fishing trip. The rain had stopped and the temperature had warmed up enough that by noon we were ready to head out for a day trip to Little Trout Lake.   On the technical front, the video quality shows the effect of my camera getting too wet the day before, but some of the still pictures came out very nicely.   On the fishing front, Scott pulled in the best fish of the trip - a 22" Lake Trout.

Trout Lake Ontario Pike We took a fly in fishing trip to Trout Lake Ontario via "Excellent Adventures" outfitters.  They were great! This is just one of many considerable sized pike we caught, sadly this is the only one I was really fortunate enough to video tape. I caught it on a "Rapala Husky Jerk" in the fire tiger pattern.  The funny part is, when I made the cast and got a small backlash that took a just a second to clear, but the pause attracted the fish and as soon as i twitched it, he was on!

Successful Fall Walleye Jigging Tips Successful Jigging Fall Walleye really starts out with the right location.  Search out those red hot spots from the summertime.  Those spots where everyone crowds, but now are left vacant do to the cold weather.  These are likely the locations you will find some fall walleye concentrating on.  Move around until you locate where a good number of fish are stacking up this fall.  They tend to be over rocky areas on points and mid lake humps, and steep drops.  Start with these locations the next time you head out on the lake and you might land yourself a bunch of fish!

How to Scale a Fish in seconds - Pressure Washer technique An incredibly fast, clean way to scale a Bass, Walleye ( pickerel) or any other scaly fish is shown.  If done right it will not bruise the fish's skin nor flesh.    Use a pressure washer with a lower pressure nozzle ( green colour nozzle  ) starting at the tail on a low ( oblique) angle to lift scales.  Be sure to "blow" the scales into a non-used grassy area where they will disappear in a day or two, or other place where a blast of water-borne scales is not an issue.  Don't attract bears or raccoons with the smell of the scales etc!  First clamp the fish solidly to a plank or other surface by its tail .  Then wash off scales in seconds.  You won't believe the results!    Cooking a whole fish results in less waste and better nutrition due to the vitamins, minerals and Omega fatty acids etc in the fat under the skin.  It also results in much better bone removal than one gets by filleting.  Place the cooked fish on a platter on its side. Start removing the flesh at the top half along backbone and lift the flesh upwards to reveal the skeleton, peel off the good "fillet" and then remove the skeleton lifting it out whole from the remaining other side of the flesh which is face down on the plate.  Watch for small bones that remain as you eat!    I recommend clipping the tips off of the spiny needle fin bones of Bass or Walleye before starting to clean the fish to save your hands from wounds and also to protect the chef  while coating and cooking it.  The bass shown was a 2.5 lbs bass from the highlands of Lanark County in Ontario accessed by remote ATV  (Canada).  It was a spectacular fighter for its size and made an incredible meal when pan fried in the whole.  It was clean and perfect - no worms etc, as it was in a tiny, clean landlocked lake formed in the ice-age era. No cottages etc - nothing but pine forest and hills.  Enjoy your easy cleaned fish!

How To Bottom Bouncer Fall Walleye Fall walleye can sometimes be difficult to find.  Using a slow troll or drift with a bottom bouncer and spinner rig tipped with a night crawler can help you find those fish over key pieces of structure.  When conditions are right this set up can really produce well all year and especially when the leaves turn yellow and autumn is in the air.  Watch this video for a few tips on rigging and running your bottom bouncers to catch more walleye this fall.

Amazing Underwater Walleye Strike Spinner Rig Trolling for walleye with a spinner rig and night crawler on the downrigger and underwater GoPro Hero.  It proved difficult to entice a bite so close to the camera housing and canon ball but two walleye were brave enough to take the worm on camera.  The water was a bit murky but you can still see what is going on as the walleye move in and hit the spinner rig with trailing night crawler in 20 feet of water.  I'll be trying to get more footage of walleye... I'll just have to find some clear water and crazy walleye action.

How To Trolling Hoochie Fishing for Halibut I did all the reading about how to catch a Halibut while trolling.  We put on a big green and white hoochie and lowered it to the bottom on South Bank off Ucuelet.  Then lowered the cannon ball to the bottom of the ocean.  Drop the ball till it hits.  Then raise, then drop... do this over till soon you are right about the bottom.  Your rigger with be out quite a bit more than actual depth due to drag.  Pay close attention to the downrigger in case you snag the bottom.  While trolling close to the bottom 1.5 to 2 mph with a sweet spot of 1.7mph will get you into the correct speed for halibut.  I got lucky and hooked up on a nice one.  I think we had another one hit that got off as well.

Sask Yak Fishing - What I used to start yak fishing Here's a few images of what I used to get into yak fishing on a budget, as you will see I've also upgraded my yak for the new season and started rigging my Pelican Catch 120. I'm hoping to start recording videos in the near future, of course that's when I get something to record with. I started out with the Pelican Strike 100, it was a nice yak but the seat wasn't very comfortable at all, so I made my own seat, it lacked the stability I needed for yak fishing. I upgraded to the Pelican Catch 120, it's 11' 8" wide which is awesome for many reasons, it also comes with a very comfortable seat that's adjustable. I started rigging the Catch 120 from the moment it arrived home. :D ['Yak fishing', 'Sask Fishing', 'Pelican Catch 120', 'Fishing', 'Kayak', 'Pelican', 'Catch 120', 'Sask', 'Regina', 'Regina Sask']

Gabby    Gabby Goes Fishing   (1943)    Fleischer Studios-1 cartoons Short, fat, boastful Gabby finds a boy fishing and offers his advice. Of course, the boy was doing much better before Gabby arrived. In short order, Gabby loses the boy's catch and bait. When Gabby is taunted by a fish, he rents a boat, tackle, and supplies and goes after the fish. Gabby's brief success is cut short when the fish pulls two plugs from the bottom of the boat; with Gabby's hands occupied plugging the holes, the fish raids his lunch box. Time for the secret weapon: a harpoon gun. The fish ties the harpoon line around an old motor, which starts, destroys the boat, and hauls Gabby around like a water-skier. The boy catches him in his net. Other that a big fish taunting the stupid Gabby, and then swimming away doing the backstroke, I didn't laugh at too many things here. So far, I've only seen a few Gabby cartoons and they have all been more annoying than funny. This guy is a real jerk!  Gabby is a know-it-all character who always butts into other people's affairs and screws it up. Here, a little boy is fishing and catching one after the other. Gabby comes along, tells him he doesn't know what he's doing, and totally messes up, ruining the kids' day. That's funny? No.  At least the main fish in here was funny. I enjoyed watching "him." How many fish do you see jump in a boat and start eating the guy's sandwich?!! The 'toon got points for that fish.  Classic cartoons from the early 20th century until about 1950,  and classical music, early jazz and blues, some mountain music and children's tunes.  Everything here is child safe and child approved.  We have just about every animated movie short there is available on the internet.  They come from DePatie-Freleng and all their friends including Pink Panther, Ant and the Aardvark, Looney tunes, the Inspector and Merrie Melodies.  There's Fable Studios, Harvey Entertainment, Henson Studios,  Hugh Harmon Productions, Ub Iwerks Studios, Chuck Jones, Van Beuren, United Artists, Columbia, Walt Disney Studios, Famous Studios, Filmation Studios, Fleischer Studios, Fox Studios, Hanna-Barbera,  MGM Studios, Paramount Studios, Universal Studios and Warner Bros. Studios. Characters??  There are all to many to list here and do them any justice.  If you can think of a character that has its origins in American Animation History, we either have it or we can find it.  Some cartoon videos are gone forever, however, many that have that same character in a staring role are available.  All you have to do is drop us a line, and we will do our best to locate it.    So, Like, subscribe and follow us and we will keep you up with things that are better than TV.    Andythebeagle.

From Ocean to Table. Smelt Fishing right on the English Bay Beach, Vancouver, Canada The video clips from May 31, and June 3, 2012. Smelt Fishing on a cloudy day on the deserted beach and the 2nd day sometimes some sunshine . This is seasonal fishing starts on the 15th of May(only Thurdsay to Sunday on high tide) up to 15th of June, then 2 months break(no fishing) and then starts after 15th of August, but the fishing will be slow down day by day. When I was here in Vancouver in the mid 90's there were thousands of people fished on the beaches, but now a days not so many fishes are over there. It is good eating fish and I prefer better than even Salmon ['Canada', 'Vancouver', 'English', 'Bay', 'smelt', 'fishing']

Fishing Lyman Plugs Lyman Plugs resemble a wounded or struggling fish and other predatory fish find them irresistible.  They fish well from 2mph+ making them lethal in both freshwater and Tidal waters.  When trolling them use them with both a Downrigger or slip weight with at least 25' of leader from the weight or downrigger.  Before you send them, make sure that they are swimming side to side evenly for best results.  Enjoy the video!

Sockeye Salmon - Spawning @ Hardy Falls Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), also called red salmon or blueback salmon, is an anadromous species of salmon found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and rivers discharging into it. There are also completely landlocked populations of the same species, which are known as the kokanee. Sockeye salmon is the third most common Pacific salmon species, after pink and chum salmon.[2] The name "sockeye" is believed to be a folk adaptation of the anglicization of sθə́qəy̓, its name in Halkomelem, the language of the indigenous people along the lower reaches of the Fraser River.

Trout jumping for worms II All trout survived the winter! The ice was pretty thick on the pond this year and it was just last week when the final thin layer melted.  All trout look healthy and active.  They couldn't wait to get a feed of worms. The large trout are more reluctant to jump for worms than the smaller ones. The grass and other vegetation  is still brown as it is still early spring here.  These trout are brook or speckled trout but the local name often used is mud trout.  Toutes les truites survécu à l'hiver! La glace était assez épaisse sur l'étang cette année et c'était juste la semaine dernière lorsque la dernière couche fine et fondue.

Alaska's Best Fishing Lodge www.docwarners.com We wouldn't call it a "...Fishing Lodge" if we couldn't provide the Alaska Halibut Salmon fishing experience. A 300-pound Halibut, though rare, isn't a dream. Neither are those elusive 50-pound King Salmon. More abundant are the fighting Silver Salmon that seem determined to tow your boat across Icy Straits. And, there's more!  Pink Salmon, Chum Salmon, and Dolly Varden (the fish, not the country singer) are always a good challenge, to say nothing of the rock fish, cod and other sea creatures vying for your attention (and eating your bait). With all these fish, you are virtually guaranteed a successful fishing experience. ['deep sea fishing', 'outdoors', 'wildlife', 'sport fishing', 'cooking classes', 'site seeing', 'fly fishing']

Episode 05: Triploid Trout Each year lower mainland lakes are stocked with thousands of Rainbow Trout.  These fish are "triploids" a modified fish that cannot reproduce.  These fish are eager biters, and very easy to catch. That results in lots of fun for everyone.  These fish provide an excellent opportunity for many anglers to be able to fish close to home with good success.  One doesn't need expensive gear, a simple fishing rod with a weight and hook and maybe a bobber will easily catch these spunky trout..  This is a great opportunity to take a young person out, and teach them to fish.  I -STRONGLY- encourage everyone to get out there and give it a try!

How to Ice Fishing: Perch Tactics These yellow perch are by no means jumbos as they are from a stunted lake with no natural predators besides us humans to put a damper on their numbers.  This was my first time fishing this lake and during this video I explain the process I go through on a new lake in order to find where perch are located.  Also once you have them located some of the best ways to put them on the ice to have a nice perch fry for dinner.  The perch may be small but they still taste great and my Tactical recommendations will likely help you find and catch fish on any lake that has a population of perch whether big or small.

Saranac Lake man shows passion on the ice in popular fishing derby! The Colby Classic Ice Fishing Derby in Saranac Lake, NY has been around since 1984. The anglers who participate do so with a passion not just for hooking the big one but also for the love of the sport and being one with nature. I had the opportunity to follow one man's journey through the popular two-day community event.  In researching the story I found a quote from American writer William Tapply that sums up the experience. He states, "I've gone fishing thousands of times in my life, and I have never once felt unlucky or poorly paid for those hours on the water."  The Colby Classic remains as vibrant as it was when it began 29 years ago. It will most certainly evoke a sense of community for many years to come. It is organized each year by The Saranac Lake Fish & Game Club.  -Josh Clement (Producer/Mountain Lake PBS)  See more of my work online: http://www.mountainlake.org/bn  Visit the Mountain Lake PBS website: http://www.mountainlake.org/  Also on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/mlpbs ['Fishing (TV Genre)', 'Fish', 'Saranac Lake (City/Town/Village)', 'Saranac', 'Village (Fictional Setting)', 'Ice Fishing', 'Brian Lewis', 'Kyle Lewis', 'Adam Lewis', 'Fishing Tournament (Competition Type)', 'Fly', 'Saranac Lake Fish & Game Club', 'Demo']

Monster Alberta Northern Pike Whitefish Lake Monster Alberta Northern Pike Whitefish Lake  Monster Alberta Northern Pike Whitefish Lake  Monster Alberta Northern Pike Whitefish Lake  Monster Alberta Northern Pike Whitefish Lake  Monster Alberta Northern Pike Whitefish Lake   Whitefish lake is not too far from where we usually fish so I decided to head there after seeing some nice walleye on Instagram posted by a local.  Careful though the water level is down and there are exposed rock islands and large boulders at the launch, stay trimmed up for at least 100-200 yards out.  We headed across to a couple underwater islands and started trolling crankbaits. The first to go was a minnow pattern Rapala Tail Dancer.  The fish fought long and hard and turned out to be a monster northern pike.  Not a bad fish for the first fish ever at a lake.  Beginners luck I guess.  Then we went on to catch some nice walleye as well on crankbaits and jigging a kastmaster.  Get out there and try it out seems to be loaded with fish judging by my fish finder.

Swingin' D Fly by Mike Schultz The ORIGINAL Bar Flies – Mike Schultz, Swingin’ D Streamer  Smallmouth junkies, this one’s for you! Our top-producing Smallmouth fly of 2014 was cooked up by our own Mike Schultz. Embodying many of the principals in Tommy Lynch’s D&D flies, the Swingin’ D is optimized for Smallies. The foam diver head gives it more of a “dart” and less of a “roll”. Faster to tie than your average “D” and designed for durability against chunk Smallies.  Best fished on an intermediate line and running higher in the water column. Make sure you’re using a very “sharp” retrieve and exaggerating the pause. They always eat on the pause…  The all white “Ghost Minnow” (shown) is our go-to, but make sure to pay your respects to Tito Santana with a chartreuse head.  Looking for hard to find materials to tie Schultzy’s Swingin’ D? Give Schultz Outfitters a call (734-544-1761).

Pacific Sanddab (Flounder) Fishing, Gabriola Island, BC - 720p HD Will and I got bored of staring at the downriggers not doing anything... so we decided to take a break from trolling and catch some flatfish. These little guys are agressive so if they're there, you'll catch them. They'd be great fighters on ultralight gear, but it would be pretty hard to get split-shot down to 200ft. We just used our regular jigging rods, herring chunks for bait and 16oz. weights to combat the current. The best thing about catching Sanddab is that they are really tasty. Just gut 'em and fry 'em... Delicious.

Kayak fishing Middle Saranac Lake in the Adirondack Park on October 11, 2016 Kayak fishing Middle Saranac Lake in the Adirondack Park on October 11, 2016. Me and a three of my fishing buddies camped on a lean-to site on Weller Pond for few nights. We had four boats total that we paddled/motored to the site from the launch (about 5 miles). Two of my friends had square stern canoes with small motors and one friend had a sit-inside kayak.  I had an Eddyline Carribean 14 Angler sit-on-top kayak that I've modified quite a bit. This trip was the debut of my Torqeedo Ultralight 403 kayak motor that I was trolling with when I caught this pike.  This was the last day of our trip and we were fishing on the way back to the launch from our site.  I should also mention that I hadn't caught any fish on this trip until this pike. I was using light gear (6 lb florocarbon).  There were several times during the fight that I should have lost this fish...but somehow I landed him and successfully let him live to bite another day! This video was not edited at all and was shot using a GoPro Hero Black with the head band mount.  Hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed the moment! Cheers!

Nice Striper! I caught this beauty on the Miramichi River in my kayak.  While fishing from a boat and hunting with a rifle is "fun", there's nothing like fishing from a kayak and hunting with a bow.

It's still early, but catching two 17"+ fish in two weekends in two different areas is giving me hopes of a wicked summer!! :) (I wish my GoPro was at a lower angle, I'll try and make sure it is on my next outing!)

Smallie Mayhem! Went out for about 5 hours of Smallmouth fishing today, caught somewhere between 20 and 30 but lost the official count. Average fish size was 14-16 inches, but I did catch a few bigger, the longest being 19".  Top fighter, top weight, and top length all went to different fish today.  Catching these guys on a Shakespeare Micro lite rod, Pflueger spinning reel, and 6 lb braid is the way to go!

"Remote Wilderness" camping trip 2016 2 years ago we had an invite with our kayak fishing group to go explore a new spot.  We liked it so much that we shared our experience with our close friends who have kids the same age as ours, and we have now gone two consecutive years with them as well.  Although the fishing wasn't as great this year as it has been in the past, the weather cooperated and we had a great weekend, for the third year in a row! It was a 2 hour drive, then a 2+ km drive to the lake, then loading all the gear onto kayaks and rafts for a 90 minute paddle to the remote island where the old cabin is located........ sounds a bit like the starting of almost every horror movie I've ever watched, but so far, so good! :) No running water, no electricity, no plumbing, just an outhouse and a roof to sleep under, but the lake is beautiful and holds several different species of fish (although pickerel are the true kings of this lake.  Large boulders tower over you everywhere, and also hide just inches under the surface of the water, keeping motor boats out.  In the 3 years I've been there, I've only ever seen one other boat on the lake the same time as us, and they didn't seem to stay very long before they went back to the distant shoreline.  It's an isolated paradise...... noticed how I haven't said the location? ;) ***This is more of a video showing the beauty of this gem of a spot than it is a "fishing" video, although there are a few fish in here too.

Catch #3 of the day My third catch of the morning.  There were 15 kayak fishermen out, a few of us caught 4-6 fish, a few caught 1 or 2, and the rest were skunked, so I was pretty happy with my second attempt at this.  (I went one day last year and caught 2)  This is a great way to get back into fishing before the trout and bass fishing gets hot!

How to catch Trout fly fishing from the fly vise to the lake How to catch Trout fly fishing from the fly vise to the lake.  One thing you will notice on our website is that we do not shy away from sharing secrets.  Not only in this video do we show this fly pattern catching fish, we show you how to tie it.  The BK Dragonfly nymph is a very simple fly to tie.  Even a novice fly tier can produce this tested Trout pattern and catch Trout.  We use the BK Dragonfly nymph on a full sinking line with a fast sinking rate between type 4 - 6 or 6 inches per second.  Use a leader length of 10' - 12' and either troll slowly or cast to the shallows and retrieve erratically using short and long strokes no longer than 6 inches. Fly fishing in Canada Obviously, there is more to fly fishing than just tying this pattern on your rod and catching fish.  What the guides at Pemberton Fish Finder do prior to taking our clients to a lake is check the vegetation along the shoreline to see what the Trout are eating.  This is where the term match the hatch comes into play.  Not only do we match the hatch we watch to see what the aquatic life does under a stressful environment.  Does it dart, swim, weave or lay still?  These are important questions that need answering if you are going to fly fish a pattern properly.  Our fly fishing guides can help you understand the fundamentals of fly fishing and get you on the fast track to success.  Visit our website for more information about fly fishing and rates. We look forward to fly fishing with you, Pemberton Fish Finder.  https://pembertonfishfinder.com/  Below is a fly fishing video of our new Trout pattern called the BK Dragonfly Nymph.  This pattern was featured on http://fridaynightflies.com/ .  Friday Night Flies is a complete resource of fly tying patterns and recipes.  We mix in a bit of small talk and Canadian humor.  The slogan for Friday Night Flies is "Tying a fly fishing recipe for the Weekend".  Check out there live shows every Friday night at 5PM PST.

Bass fishing on Blue Lake 2016 Blue Lake is located in the Halliburton Forest, which is about 45 minutes from Minden or about 3.5 hours away from Toronto. It is a small lake that is about 5 acres in size with a depth of 35 feet. The lake has plenty of small-mouth bass and some perch. It used to be stocked with Rainbow Trout, but they are scarce now. Hopefully it gets re-stocked in the future. We had plenty of action with bass lures and Mepps spoons with worms on them. Gas Motors are not permitted on this small lake. Ice fishing is permitted and Blue Lake is right across the street from MacDonald Lake. It is about 270 kilometres (170 mi) northeast of Toronto, and just south of Algonquin Provincial Park.

I am working hard to fix that issue!*  I will post the equipment used in this video on my next video, as my tackle rarely changes.  Mainly using a jig set up with live night crawlers as bait.

2 Reel Fishing Adventures - Sooke, British Columbia We went out for a full day of Chinook (King, Spring) Salmon fishing with 2 Reel Fishing Charters.  http://www.2reel.ca    We can't explain how much fun we had with them and fishing guide Ron Neitsch. Leaving the docks at Sooke Harbour Resort and Marina, early in the morning, we arrived at the fishing grounds 10 minutes later. The water was nice and calm, something not unusual in this area. No ground swells and large rollers like the open ocean.     We spent a full day with 4 large Salmon on the gear but only 1 in the boat. I can tell you though that the fun is with the fish on, getting them to the boat is ideal, but it's certainly not disappointing.     The battles lasted anywhere from 3-8 minutes. The fight is intense and physical.     It was a blast. I will do it again with 2 Reel Fishing Adventures in Sooke, BC. Located on Vancouver Island, just a 45 minute drive from downtown Victoria, BC.

The Muskies, Northern Pike  and Walleye's in this area are notoriously large.  As the 7 days go by we fished much of Collins Inlet, Mill Lake, Beaverstone Bay and beyond. We did have 2 days that were not productive. Due to high winds as cold fronts moving through the area. We did not catch any true lunkers, but we each had a large musky on our lines; John's musky was certainly in the 50 inch class. But both muskies jumped, through the lures and swam away.  We caught approximately 50 pike and 1 largemouth bass. But in our minds it is not necessarily the number and size of the fish! One or two fish a day pleases us; but it is the exceptionally beautiful vistas, the huge wilderness of waterways and islands, the viewing of a variety of wildlife on foot ,wings and fins, the warm hospitality of the local people and lodge staff, these are priceless memories, along with the big fish that got away!!! In this video you will note at various times, a skeleton of a sunken steam ship, the location of the ghost town community of Collins Inlet, and the remains of the lumber mills wooden pier. I have included a historical discription of the Ghost Town in the followling paragraphs. Lumbering began in the area of Collins Inlet around the year 1865 when the province of Ontario opened up rights to harvest lumber in the area. In 1868 a small sawmill named the Collins Inlet Lumber Company began operating out of the area. The mill's specialty was producing wood, cut from the La Cloche Mountain Range, to be used for laths, boxes and for ship building.  Lumber was stored in large piles in the backwoods during the winter until spring, when the lumber could be floated down the Mahzenazing River. Twice a week steamer ships docked at the inlet to load lumber, unload mail and supplies. During the winter the site was completely isolated.  The Collins Inlet Lumber Co. was taken over in 1886 by John Bertram. By that time the site had grown to include a boarding house, homes, store and a school. Mr. Bertram increased the size of the mill and added a 100-foot high sawdust burner. The older homes, which were poorly constructed, were replaced with more modernized homes.  A boat works and post office were later built at the site.   The Collins Inlet post office saw erratic activity. First opened in 1869, the office closed in 1877 and remained closed until 1883. In 1883 it was reopened and served as a full-time post office until 1938 when it was used solely as a summer office. The post office finally closed for good in 1945  As of today, one old building remains and is dilapidated. The old boarding home is long gone and replaced by the now idle Mahzenazing River Lodge. Inside the lodge are some old pictures and an aerial picture showing what the entire site once looked like.  The City of London, a ship built in 1865, sank off the shore in 1875 and can still be seen in the waters today.  John Bertram died in 1904. His lumber mill continued after his death, until 1918 when it was destroyed by fire. After the fire the machinery was salvaged for the war effort, the town abandoned. The company schooner was scuttled (flooded).   The lumbering activity continued in the area well into the 1930's.

Salmon viewing at Adams River BC Nearly 10 million sockeye salmon returned in 2010 to the Fraser River and the Adams River.  In Alaska there is a river that sees up to 22 million sockeye salmon return with Alaska brown bears (grizzly) anxiously awaiting this bounty. Native, commercial and sport fishermen pursue the sockeye salmon from California to Alaska, out in the open North Pacific and the rivers the salmon enter to spawn and die.  Of all the salmon species the sockeye has the broadest migration range in the Pacific Ocean, reaching as far as Japan.

Trout Spawning in natural environment. HD video. HD video of trout spawning in Markham Ontario stream. Two males competing for the right to reproduce with one female. I'm not sure what kind they are but because they were spawning in the spring, I'm guessing they might be Rainbows.  During the spawning season, fish become more difficult to see. From above, female backs are exactly the same shade as nest gravel. Even males are well-disguised from the top, although their sides remain colorful.  Females swish their tails to hollow out a spot in the gravel. While they are making their nests, males are gathering around.  Males often fight and it isn't unusual to see males with chewed-off tails, missing eyes or body punctures! Some die of their wounds.  During spawning, the hens drop low in their nests and  eject eggs. Meanwhile, the male sprays milt (sperm).  The eggs that drop into the nest are fertilized.  The hen quickly swishes gravel over the eggs, to hide them from predators. This may be repeated several times, eggs stacking in layers with gravel.  With small trout, the spawning may only take a day or two; for larger trout, about 5 days is the norm.  Females produce about 400 eggs per pound of their weight (for example: an 8 ounce female would produce a total of about 200 eggs during spawning season).  After about 3 months, the tiny fish leave the nest and strike out on their own.

Sockeye Salmon - Kokanee spawning in  Sony HD Locals know that the best spot for seeing Sockeye Salmon - land locked kokanee salmon spawning in the Okanagan is near Peachland in Trepanier Creek.  We went and checked Mission Creek and its's man made spawning channel and found fewer and smaller  fish, with the man made appearance overwhelming. I wonder why Kelowna couldn't just let the fish spawn in Mission Creek as the Koanee have for eons before white man decided that we could improve on nature.  Some sockeye live and reproduce in lakes and are called "kokanee", a word in the Okanagan language for this kind of fish. They are much smaller than the ones that go to the ocean and are rarely over 350 millimetres (14 in) long. In Okanagan Lake and many others there are two kinds of kokanee populations - one spawns in streams and one spawns in the lake near the shore. As an aside, the Kokanee Glacier gets its name from Kokanee Creek, which enters Kootenay Lake near Nelson, British Columbia.

Rise of the Salmon People (trailer) http://www.salmonpeople.ca  http://vimeo.com/27686633  Wild Salmon feed the people and economies of countless communities in British Columbia, both inland and coastal. The Fraser River Watershed births the largest run of Sockeye Salmon on Earth, yet in 2009, only 1 million of the expected 13 million Sockeye returned to the Fraser River to spawn. Now, perhaps for the first time, diverse communities in BC are coming together with a common goal -- to save Wild Salmon. First Nations Communities, Environmentalists, Tourism industries, and Fishing Villages are uniting and uprising.    Wild Salmon are not only an endangered icon of British Columbia; they are the backbone of this Province, ecologically and economically. Decades of overfishing by commercial fisheries, destruction of spawning habitat by clear-cut logging, hydro-electric dams, and more recently, fish farms on the coast have had catastrophic impacts to the Wild Salmon in BC.

Post Spawn Tactics for Northwestern Ontario Musky Three days into the 2013 Musky Season in Northwestern Ontario (opens the 3rd Saturday in June), Mike Grant and Heinrich Bier of Giant Quest spent 2 days fishing and filming on a small lake. While fishing the likely spawning areas they were only able to contact male musky, meaning the fish were likely done spawning.  Ice-off and the spring season came to a slow start in Northwestern Ontario. On larger water bodies like LOTW some fish were still in pre-spawn and/or spawn mode. Giant Quest would to stress that it is important not target large females that have not completed spawning, regardless of whether the season is open or not. Many management jurisdictions in the USA allow fishing for pre-spawn and spawning muskies, but it is important to note that most States have significant stocking programs. In Northwestern Ontario, we have to rely on a self-sustaining population, hence the season opening after the fish are done spawning in late June. However, years like 2013 (and 2014 will even later) mother nature is behind and the legal date doesn't work to protect the fish. It is up to us to be diligent and think critically about which fish we target.

A caplin scull, Sandy Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull, Newfoundland) This past Saturday, Ronan, Cormac my Dad and I went to Sandy Cove on the Eastport Peninsula to see if the caplin were rolling. We were in luck! The caplin scull is an amazing sight worth seeing and a lot of fun. These small fish migrate from the deep ocean and spawn on the beach. For centuries, Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have taken this opportunity to catch these fish as they roll in the coves and bays around the province. They make for a great meal, but are also prized as fertilizer on vegetable gardens. This was Ronan and Cormac's first time seeing the caplin roll and they had a blast. It took a while to figure out the best way to catch them, but by the end we were catching them with our hands. Newfoundland noodling! Fresh caplin fried for breakfast the next day was a great treat. There is no set date to witness this natural spectacle, but it generally happens in late June and early July.

Global Changes Threaten Sockeye Salmon Run Sockeye Salmon are among the most desirable salmon, fetching the highest market value per pound.  They return in huge numbers to river across the USA and Canada.  The world is changing though and salmon are now facing more challenges then ever before.  Over fishing, Fish Farms, Global Warming, Drought, Disease, and Ocean Contamination all impact the survival of the species.  There isn't a whole lot that can be done, but urge for more control of wild fish stocks.  Removal of fish farms and dams.  Let's protect this resource before it is gone.  This year there was no Sockeye fishery on the Fraser River in Canada.  We don't want this to become the way of the future.  Wild Salmon need our help, mostly by leaving them alone to do their own thing that they have done for thousands of years.

Kid SCREAMS while she catches HUGE 40" NORTHERN PIKE by herself fishing in CANADA FREAKED OUT Young Girl Catches HUGE pike Listen to this girl SCREAM! Fish on tight lines catch and release Catching Northern Pike  While fishing in Canada my kids and I were trolling.  My daughter hooks into the first fish of the trip and it was the biggest one we caught during the 12 days of our trip.  At first I thought it was just a normal fish, but then it starts taking line.  I quickly hooked the pole to a double sided caribiner bungee cord just in case she were to drop the pole.  She screamed cried and yelled a whole bunch.  I see she even cinched down on the line a few times, but it didn't break.  I tried to get line out so she could move it over to me to unhook, but she was so freaked out she kept reeling it all back in.  In the end we got it and let it go.  It was just over 38 inches.  This was the first fish pike she has ever hooked up and caught!  My biggest is an inch shorter and I've been pounding the water pretty hard for close to 40 years.  It was nice this summer traveling to a few lakes I know had some decent fish.  I know there are bigger ones on there, but it sure was a nice fish.  People on the other side of the lake could hear her yelling and screaming.  We were near a campground and they were all cheering.  by the time we got it all the lines were reeled in and we had drifted up to shore.  We were using barbless hooks which made the unhooking easier, but the lure had 3 treble hooks on it and it was pretty scary reaching down to pick it up.  I think I will change the front hooks to singles.  She was a real champ and after she caught it had a pole in her hand pretty much the whole trip.  She hooked up on a bunch more fish all on her own.  She helped teach my other two kids how to cast and was a real pro out there.  My son learned and caught several fish on his own.  he even caught a 32" lake trout which I would guess weighed 12-15 pounds.  He battled it on his own.  My daughter helped balance the pole off the side of the boat.  I will be posting that as well.  It was fun to let the kids experience the fish and I didn't really care if they got off.  My goal was to let them get it done on their own. catching big pike catching pike on lures catching pike on spoons catching pike with minnows catching pike with sucker fathead leech shiner trout bass sunfish bluegill walleye laker fishing from a boat end up on shore fishing catching pike in a pond catching pike in a river system Catching huge pike monster northern pike for a little kid Northern Pike fishing Northern pike attacks northern pike attack northern pike Northern pike eat duck frogs snails bugs and other fish including themselves cannibals fishing in Canana Ontario Mason Lake  Saskatchewan British Columbia Yukon Territory Northwest territory Alberta Quebec Up north big fish little kid wisconsin Gryga fishing in Minnesota Bailey Lake BWCA Boundary waters canoe area Fishing in michigan New york Pennsylvania Montana Jeff ['Fishing', 'Out', 'Lake', 'Fly', 'Catch', 'Michigan', 'Northern Pike (Animal)', 'Big', 'Bass', 'Largemouth Bass (Organism Classification)', 'River', 'Rapids', 'Trout', 'Salmon', 'Fish (Animal)', 'Esox (Organism Classification)', 'Canada', 'Scary', 'Funny', 'Scared', 'scream', 'weird', 'You can Fix It!!!!', 'jgryga']

Unique fishing techniques |How To Catch fish | Amazing Fishing Moment | fishing in a Lake Unique fishing techniques, How To Catch fish, Amazing Fishing Moment, fishing in a Pool:  ======================================================  Bangladesh Fishing And Fisher Man Info: ------------------------------------------------------------------ Bangladesh being a first line littoral state of the Indian Ocean has a very good source of marine resources in the Bay of Bengal. The country has an exclusive economic zone of 41,000 square miles (110,000 km2), which is 73% of the country's land area. On the other hand, Bangladesh is a small and developing country overloaded with almost unbearable pressure of human population. In the past, people of Bangladesh were mostly dependent upon land-based proteins. But, the continuous process of industrialization and urbanization consumes the limited land area. Now there is no other way than to harvest the vast under water protein from the Bay of Bengal, which can meet the country's demand.  More than 80 percent of the animal protein in the Bangladeshi diet comes from fish. Fish/ fishing accounted for 6 percent of GDP in the fiscal year of 1970, nearly 50 percent more than modern industrial manufacturing at that time. Most commercial fishermen are low-caste Hindus who eke out the barest subsistence working under primitive and dangerous conditions. They bring a high degree of skill and ingenuity to their occupation; a few of the most enterprising ones are aided by domesticated otters, which behave like shepherds, swimming underwater, driving fish toward the fisherman's net (and being rewarded themselves with a share of the catch). Fish for local consumption are generally of freshwater varieties  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Bangladesh Marine Fisheries Academy: """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Bangladesh Marine Fisheries Academy(BMFA)[1] is a government-run training institution in Bangladesh for cadets wishing to enter the fishing industry, merchant shipping and other related maritime industries.[2] Established in 1973, it is the only national organization offering training for these professions.  It started as Juldia Marine Academy in Juldia, CHittagong in 1962.[3] The present academy started its journey as a project of Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation (BFDC) on 1 September 1973 and on 20 April 1988 it came under the administrative control of Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock as a project.[2] But on 1 July 1993 the Academy was transferred to revenue budget under the same Ministry.[2] Since then the Academy is functioning under the Administrative control of the Ministry. The functional authority of the Academy is vested on the Principal who has three assisting organs namely Academic Council, Board of Studies and Board of Discipline.   .................................................................................................................

GOOD TIMES. ['Kayak Fishing', 'Winter (Quotation Subject)', 'Fishing (TV Genre)', 'River (Geographical Feature Category)', 'Snow', 'Ice', 'Cold', 'new kayak']

For anyone whom has never brought in a Sturgeon, your in for a total fight.  The fish is pure power and goes where it want's to.  What ever control you can get on the direction, and keep it from rolling, or snagging up the line of timber in the river is another challenge.

How to Be Out Fished by Online Fishing Buddy - Ice Fishing Rainbow Trout The internet is a prime location to meet all sort of people... especially those with the same passions and love for ice fishing as yourself.  Today I met up with Jamie to try a lake I had never been to before, but had heard plenty about.  Who better to go with than a new fishing buddy and lake expert, Jamie!  Going fishing with friends always doubles the fun and probably at least doubles the amount of fish you'll be pulling out of the hole!  So if you lack a fishing buddy I recommend checking out the fishing forums in your area, facebook, youtube and other sources.  You will be sure to find some great fishing friends to enjoy some time on the ice with.  Check out this big fat rainbow trout we were catching on this lake. It was a lot of fun out there.  No five pounders but we did get some decent fish.

Mid Lake Hump JUMBO Perch GoPro Hero Sometimes locating mid summer Yellow Perch can be a bit Tricky.  In this video we found them on a mid lake hump which is a piece of structure out in the middle of the lake.  This structure tops off at 17 feet and drops off to 30 feet in the surrounding area.  This is a prime fish holding location throughout the year, especially when the water heats up and those fish go deep!  Keep your eye on your sonar when driving down the lake to locate these deep water structures.  You'll be happy you did.

Catching Fall Cold Front Walleye Fishing the Fall Season can lead to some nasty weather, but the fish seem to enjoy the nasty weather at this time of year more than they do in the summer months.  So don't be afraid to get out on the lake in the wind and rain as those fish are probably still biting.  Try a small presentation and slow things down, hold on tight because you're in for a great day on the water.  This is definitely the Ukrainian Fishing Machine!

How to Fishing Northern Pike with Jaw Jacker and Rod Review This is my first time trying out the new Jaw Jacker Rods in the 35" length.  These are developed for fishing northern pike and lake trout.  Unfortunately our go to lake trout lake didn't have the best ice this year due to warm temperatures so we tried them out on pike instead.  We had amazing action setting them up with a quick strike rig and herring.  I left  a couple feet of slack in the line and I think I only had one or two missed fish all day.  I thought this was great considering how big the baits are.  These rods had a ton of back bone and get a great hook set on these fish.  Really happy with the whole set up for pike.  Check it out and enjoy some crazy pike action on the Jaw Jacker.

Normark Fin Bore III Best Ice Auger Review Normark Fin-Bore 3 Hand Ice Auger or Ice Drill is a great little tool for getting you through the ice and to the fish.

Extreme Ice Fishing Spray Lake Trout This has to be one of the most extreme weather ice fishing experiences I have ever fished.  The wind was howling and snow blowing filling your hole and covering your gear in a minute or so.  Got out there in the dark at Driftwood and hiked out to the middle.  Where I drilled it was about 65 feet deep.  I was marking fish near the bottom which were slow movers and following the jig but not committing.  Then one came in and hit, then I cranked the jig up and he chased it up and grabbed it.  The MarCum really comes in handing getting fish to bit.  I landed this fish and that was to be all the luck I had.  Stayed out until noon but it was just too cold to stay longer.  What a crazy day, stunning scenery and sunrise.  title created with www.flixpress.com ['Lake Trout (Organism Classification)', 'Ice Fishing', 'Fishing', 'Lake Trout', 'Extreme', 'Weather', 'Wind', 'JawJacker', 'Jaw Jacker', 'Spray Lake', 'Alberta', 'Canmore', 'Canada', 'The Fishing Doctor', 'Bucktail Jig', 'Smelt', 'Bait', 'Jigging', 'MarCum', 'Amazing', 'Best', 'tips', 'tricks', 'information', 'help', 'need', 'tutorial']
Amazing Underwater Rainbow Trout on Slender Spoon Loads of Rainbow Trout were tracking down and attacking the slender spoon under the ice.  I can't believe how many fish are down there.  Most of the fish are the Pennask or Kamloops rainbows with the odd Fat Fraser Valley Rainbow that swims by.  Also a few brook trout show up to play.  This is a 1/8 oz slender spoon in gold and green tipped with a piece of shrimp.  But you can see that even with a bare hook they were still attacking it.

When Perch Attack The Cicada Strikes Back - Underwater GoPro Video This video was taken on the same day that I also captured the underwater video of fishing with Northland Tackles Gill-Getter.  The perch were not interested at all in the Gill-Getter, but when I dropped the Reef Runner Cicada down in Chartreuse and Glow they were attacking it without hesitation.  Check out the underwater footage and how some of the Jumbo Yellow Perch inhale this Cicada!  These perch were on the prowl chasing down shiners and spread out over this sand flat.  The Cicada can really draw the fish in with its flash and vibration over a long distance.  It also helps you key in on those bigger fish and keeps some of the smaller fish away. Give them a try next time you're on the hunt for jumbo perch.

How to catch Jumbo Perch on Reef Runner Cicada The Reef Runner Cicada, especially in its larger sizes may not strike you as a go to perch lure.  Let me tell you though it has a perch catching ability like some of the best perch lures out there.  This lure triggers aggressive behavior in larger perch that are often turned off and difficult to entice a bite from.  The other great feature is small perch often shy away from the size of this lure and its intense vibration and flash.  This leaves you with more time in the water able to catch those larger Jumbo Perch that are often waiting on the side lines.  The secret is you only want to bait the front hook and not so much so that the action is killed.  You still want that tight intense vibration on sharp jigs that brings fish in from distance as it hits their lateral line and warns them about an easy meal near by.  Both meal worms and pieces of a minnow tend to work well.  A bonus feature during the night bite is that this is also a great lure for catching those walleye on the prowl.   Give it a try next time you're on the ice!

Eskimo Shark Z 71 cc Most Powerful Ice Auger on Earth CLICK LINK FOR A GREAT DEAL ON AN ESKIMO ICE AUGER -  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IMRXR2/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=B001IMRXR2&link_code=as3&tag=thefishdoctad-20  This was a mighty cold day on the ice... -30 Degrees Celsius.  Usually this Shark starts in 2-3 easy pulls.  Here you can see it still wasn't too bad to cold start at 10 pulls and the first few didn't really look like I was trying.  This is a cold start and straight to drilling a 10 inch hole in 24 inches of ice.  It's a little smokey since the gas was mixed a bit rich on the first tank.  Usually should be 50:1 oil mixture.  This beast is 34 pounds but it feels like it will cut through anything without hesitation.  Lots of power.  The Shark z 51 cc would probably be plenty for most people.  This is what you should expect from your Eskimo if you decide to buy one.  I used it for 5 weeks this season drilling tons of holes and it works amazing!  Highly recommend an Eskimo.  My dad purchased this one and we're really happy with it.

How to Catch Monster Rainbow Trout Ice Fishing Ice fishing for some of the biggest trout I have ever caught.  These submarine rainbows below ice are absolute pigs and have a healthy diet of scuds or shrimp.

Jaw Jacker Pike and Walleye Ice Fishing in Frigid Cold Hole freezing doesn't seem to be a problem with the Jaw Jacker action on this particular day we continued to slam the walleye and pike.  I've been looking around for some Ice Stopper Bobbers, but this year I realized I really don't need them.  As long as you use a monofilament line the Jaw Jacker will still be catching fish even when your hole freezes over.  So even when your tip ups freeze into the ice on those frigid days this thing will still be putting you on some fish.  So give it a try, even if your holes are freezing over next time you're out on the water.  Just need a little fancy foot work like you'll see in the video to open the holes.

Northland Tackle Gill Getter Underwater Perch Review GoPro So with the Gill Getter the fish didn't seem as aggressive.  Barely taking the hook enough to get caught.

Watch the video I posted on Perch attacking a Cicada which was right following this video, exact same hole and see how their attitudes change.  It may just make you want to put a few in your tackle box for the next time you find some picky perch.  When you look underwater the fish give you their own opinion.

Walleye Afterglow Ice Fishing GoPro Hero 3+ Black For the angler who always has to throw the last cast and stay out just 5 minutes longer on the ice, this vid is for you!  I'm one of those people who just can't be pulled away from trying just a little longer.  Seems I've been rewarded so often for putting in that extra hour at the end of the day I just feel like it is a must to stay out and bare the cold and dark to catch another fish.  This night was no other, already had a few smaller walleye on the line earlier in the night and as things started to get too dark to see a whole lot a nice fat mark moved in on my MarCum VX 1P and closed in on my slender spoon.  I gave it a little flutter and that was all it took the fish inhaled the bait and the fight was on.  After a nice battle with the walleye on a light action rod he surfaced through the hole in the ice and posed nicely for a picture before diving back into the water for another day.  Don't go in to early, you might just miss the best bite of the day!  Title was created with www.flixpress.com.

How to catch a JawJacker Walleye This winter I was determined to catch a walleye on a JawJacker, but I knew it might be a challenge.  I seem to loose half the ones I hook on my own line, never mind one that is sitting dead stick on its own.  So after a few missed strikes I came up with the flasher jig and minnow combination with two stinger hooks.  I think this is overkill and I think you would get away with just one stuck in the tail of the minnow.  After all all the ones that I actually got up the hole were hooked well with the main jig anyways and I didn't even need the treble stingers.  Anyways check out my demo on how the Jaw Jacker can help you catch more walleye this ice season.  Good luck out there.  This is the first YouTube video catching walleye on the Jaw Jacker.

Fishing Outfits for Channel Catfish Italo goes through his outfit when fishing for catfish from March to June. You can use a 7.5ft Magnum rod not only for catfish, but also for pike and even musky.

Ice Fishing Northern Pike Walleye Perch and Whitefish in March This is spring ice fishing at it's best and the reason I love heading out at the end of the March in search of fish.

How to Fishing - Ucluelet Chinook Salmon on South Bank This was our first time out to Ucluelet and we headed out in early June.  The weather was sunny but quite windy.

Before long the rod and released and line was screaming off the drag.  Fish On!  Chinook salmon number one.  It wasn't fast in furious but we got out limit and I wouldn't say that is half bad for beginners out there on the wide open ocean if rough water.

How to Ice Fishing Brook Trout with Spoons Ice fishing for eastern brook trout can be a lot of fun especially during the early ice season.  First ice is a great time to be out fishing as long as you are careful when heading out.  We recommend not venturing out until the ice is at least 4 inches thick.  Once your local brook trout pond freezes over you can use the tips in this video to locate brook trout and convince them to bite even on the slow days.  In this video I was using a Marcum VX - 1 Pro and a silver and red slender spoon 1/8 oz tipped with a small piece of cocktail shrimp.  These brook trout are stocked as All Female Triploids so they do not display normal spawning behavior and therefore fishing varies a bit for these fish early ice from the usual diploid spawning brook trout.  These lakes are often heavily stocked so don't feel bad if you'd like to take something home to eat that is the reason these fish are put in the lakes.  Best of luck to you on the ice this season!

To Fish As Formerly: W̱SÁNEĆ Nation Brings Reef Net Fishing Back After 100 Years On August 9th, 2014, the W̱SÁNEĆ Nation went reef net fishing to reclaim a practice that the colonial government outlawed a hundred years ago. Nick Claxton (XEMŦOLTW̱), Tsawout community member and PhD. Candidate in UVic’s Department of Curriculum and Instruction, has made it his life’s work to revitalize the reef net fishery (SX̱OLE) in his community. Over the past year he built a reef net model alongside students and teachers in a local school, ȽÁU, WELṈEW̱ Tribal School. The project was so successful that teachers throughout the school—math teachers, science teachers, socials teachers—began to teach their subjects through the model net.  Meanwhile, with the help of their relatives at the Lummi Nation (Washington, US) who had recently undergone a process of reef net resurgence, Nick and members of the W̱SÁNEĆ Nation began to build the first W̱SÁNEĆ-made reef net in over a hundred years. In an act that will go down in history as the resurgence of a core part of the W̱SÁNEĆ Nation’s social, economic, spiritual, and educational society, the reef net was set at a hereditary fishing location (SWÁLET) off of Pender Island on August 9th, 2014.   This short video will give you a sense of the power of that day and what it means to “carry on our fisheries as formerly,” as agreed to in the Douglas Treaty signed by the Saanich people in 1852.

Return to the Land of the Steelhead Steelhead live in the most beautiful places on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, that is not the only draw to pursue these elusive fish. The challenge of getting them to bite keeps anglers coming back for more. The chase is what brings us to some remote canyon pools to sneek a cast down a back seam in hopes of a take. Old growth forests, rock outcrops and waterfalls are the only sign posts on elk trails that lead to hidden tailouts. Floating silently down the river in a raft, eagles overhead with your thoughts of the next deep slot that may or maynot contain a deep bodied silver slab.Can't wait until next time I walk those trails that lead to rivers edge.

Nice Brook Trout Caught Skating Caddis Dry Fly http://thejighead.com  This past weekend I got some decent footage of a nice sized brook trout  taking a Caddis dry fly pattern I was skating. While I catch less trout skating a dry fly than on a dead drift, the trout I do catch tend to be larger, more aggressive, and fight harder than those that take a dead drifted fly.  Skip to 1:13 if you want to see the fly highlighted and the strike slowed down.  If you watch the fly in the video above, you'll see that it's dead drifted over the fish first, and I only trigger a strike as I'm skating the fly back to me. I like the let the fly dead drift down the current first. When the drift is completed, I'm not to eager to rip the fly up for another cast right away. Instead, I like to skate the fly back towards myself before casting. This helps cover more water using two different techniques with less casting, and reduces the likelihood of spooking the fish.

My Last Day of Trout Fishing 2012 Here it was my last chance to do some trout fishing. Wanted to hit my favourite river but when I got there the water was really high and fast.

Charlie Boy Hopper Another outstanding pattern by master tier, Charlie Craven.  Here's an excerpt from his website, Charlie's FlyBox, about the Charlie Boy Hopper:    "I developed this pattern several years ago while guiding on Colorado's Tarryall Creek. My clients were going through Dave's Hoppers at an astounding rate and I figured there had to be a better option. While Dave's fly works fine, it becomes waterlogged after a couple fish and is a pain to tie. The Charlie Boy Hopper (named after my son) meets all of my requirements in a hopper pattern: active rubber legs, incredible durability, realistic silhouette, good visibility, and great flotation. The best part is it is especially easy to tie. I like to fish Charlie Boys in the standard tan color, as it seems to be the most common color of the naturals, as well as in yellow, green, olive and even blue/green. The blue/green color (with red rubber legs) matches the hoppers found in the hay meadows along many of our mountain streams here in Colorado. The Charlie Boy Hopper also works great as an indicator dry with a dropper. Its high visibility and superior flotation make it a natural for this application."    http://www.charliesflyboxinc.com/flybox/details.cfm?parentID=164 ['hopper', 'charlie', 'boy', 'craven', 'terrestrial', 'pattern', 'foam', 'elk', 'hair', 'dry', 'fly', 'tying', 'flytying', 'flyfishing', 'fishing', 'southern', 'alberta', 'flies', 'rainbow', 'brown', 'cutthroat', 'brook', 'bull', 'lake', 'trout']

Salmon Spawning NOW There used to be millions of salmon spawning in North American rivers from Alaska to California but now it's only a small remnant of the mighty salmon that return to the same river, same spot where they started life.

Fraser Cutthroat - Jan 20, 2010 This was one of five that I caught in just over an hour when I was out yesterday.

Pressure Bleeding Sockeye Salmon in Multiples with Pressure Bled Zane at Salt of the Surf I took the top off and turned off the sprayers to make a film of my multi-fish Sockeye pressure bleeding system configuration at that point in 2014. The 2015 system is aluminum with some super cool features I will show when I film them. For this filming, I shot footage of fish my dad and I were retaining to eat. This way I could turn off the sprayers and put the fish in the pile I did - as well as picking up the head and throwing it overboard (for spiritual return) without a bleaching of my gloves. The usual process would be, at the point where I display the fish: I dip the fish into a light bleach water tub and then I put them into the slush ice in the totes under the system.

First fishing trip of 2015... a little windy We took the trusty Sevylor Fish Hunter 280 out for the first time this year. The water is still super cold and fishing is spotty... tad windy too!

St. Croix River Canoe Trips, Maine St. Croix River Canoe Trips fully outfitted and guided by Maine Guide Dave Conley of Maine Wilderness Trips at www.canoethewild.com  Designated as a Canadian Heritage River, the St. Croix flows along the eastern Maine border with New Brunswick, offers great wilderness scenery, moderate whitewater, maintained wilderness campsites, fishing for small mouth Bass and the opportunity to spot Bald Eagles.  The St. Croix River is dam controlled which means it is runnable all summer long. With miles of quick water and numerous class I-II rapids, it's easy to see why the St. Croix is one of Maine's best canoe trips. The Fall foliage season is a great time to canoe the St Croix and often we have the river to ourselves.   Well suited for families and groups of all ages with little or no experience, the St. Croix is a great river to learn basic paddling and camping skills. The more advanced paddler will appreciate the quick water, numerous rapids and may even want to try their skill at solo paddling or canoe poling.  Paddling from Vanceboro to Little Falls makes for a relaxing day trip. Little Falls is a great spot to swim, fish, rump bump and have lunch with the opportunity to paddle or pole a class II rapid.   With numerous starting and ending points, choose a trip 1-4 days in duration. Dave and his team can take care of all your trip logistics including outfitting, shuttling of vehicles to the take out point, meals, instruction when needed and safely guide your family or group up to 25 in number.  Day trips on the St. Croix River A great trip for families and groups of all ages looking for a wilderness experience without having to camp out overnight. Swim, fish, view wildlife including bald eagles and relax around a campfire as you enjoy lunch. Day trips meet and end in Vanceboro. 8am to 5pm or an agreed upon time.

Western Washington largemouth fishing on Clear Lake. Hit Clear Lake in Skagit County on 11-08-16 and while the bite started slow with only one fish in the first 90 minutes, it picked up and I finished with a total of 8 (not 7 like the end of the video says as I caught the first before I started filming). Good November day, water temps were 52-54 degrees and the swim jig was the lure of the day.....again.

Sockeye Salmon Fishing Port Alberni Sockeye Salmon Fishing Port Alberni 2015 was great!  This is how to catch the Sockeye Salmon in the Salmon Capitol of the World.  This was supposedly one of the best runs in history because the fish were stuck in the channel waiting for the river to cool down.  Hundreds of thousands of fish were just waiting for our hook to pass by.  Although we hit the first weekend it rained and the fish started to move.  Our first day was great and then after the rain it really tapered off.  The fish were deep, from 80-120 feet down.   All caught on small Pink Hoochies.

Jumbo Perch Ice Fishing Tips: Spring Bobber Jumbo Yellow Perch Fishing is something I love to do them yet How to Catch them is often a puzzle you have to sort out.  Once you locate the fish you have to figure out what they want to eat, once you've got that down you have to dial in the action.  Once you have those combinations together you need to be able to feel an ever so lite bite.  So get yourself a spring bobber this year and snap it on your rod to increase the sensitivity you have to detect those slob jumbo perch next time you are out.

Vancouver Island Crab Fishing - The Whole Adventure A family friend took us along to go retrieve his crab pots so we could have fresh seafood for supper that night. It was quite the experience for this flatlander!  The process goes like this: Boat out to GPS waypoint (that was set when the pots were dropped) Hook the buoy with a pole, pull it in, along with the nearly 120' of leaded rope, pull the pot into the boat. Remove the crabs from the trap, measure them to ensure they are legal to keep (toss the ones that aren't), re-bait the pot, then return the pot to the water.   Once we get back to the marina, we used a "guillotine" to split the crabs right at the dock. This allows us to clean the crabs right away and keep the mess out of the kitchen.    This is the 6 minute "full" crabbing adventure. More shots, more stuff happening. For a more condensed version, check out my other video; it's just the good stuff.

Dip Net Fishing Cape-Breton Ep. 2 This time we spotted some Gaspereau in a small pond from the road. They were much smarter and less populated than the smelts were and it took a lot longer. Again the fish was returned to the water unharmed and not kept.  It took nearly an hour of crawling up and down the trickle of a brook to finally get one in the net. Sorry for the shaky cam, but it's hard to dip a fish and focus on a small camera screen at the same time.

Real Adirondack Stories | Who's the Legend: Fishing in the ADKs “If all these guys are coming from all over the United States to fish here in the Adirondacks, something good must be going on here…” Mark and his fishing buddy, Evan, check out the pros of the Bass Master Classic on Lake Champlain before heading off to make a legendary fish tale of their own here in the Adirondacks.   The Adirondack Region (http://visitadirondacks.com/) is one of the most diverse destinations on the East Coast, offering unparalleled outdoor recreation throughout its dazzling lakes, wild mountains, and charming towns and villages. Established in 1892 by the State of New York amid concerns for the water and timber resources of the region, the Adirondack Park today covers an area larger in size than  Yosemite, Yellowstone, Glacier, Grand Canyon and the Great Smokies National Parks combined, and is the largest park in the lower 48 states.  The boundary of the park, known as the Blue Line, can be found etched on historic records and clearly defined on modern maps. Encompassing 6 million acres of public, constitutionally protected forest preserve, as well as privately owned land, the park – in a word – is epic.

Brook Trout Ice Fishing Canada Quality Brook Trout Ice Fishing Canada.  Brook Trout are one of the sought after fish in Canada while ice fishing.  Usually Brook Trout live in shallow ponds that have a muddy bottom and a weedy shoreline.  They are very aggressive feeders during the Winter months and thrive in Cold Water.  Typically fish for Brook trout in 3'-6' of water in and amongst the weeds or structure.  In shallow water they can become very sensitive to noise above the ice or movement.

2015 - 2016 Pemberton Fish Finder Ice Fishing Season is a Wrap 2015-16 Pemberton Fish Finder Ice Fishing Season is a Wrap.  First of all the team at Pemberton Fish Finder would like to thank all of our clients for a fun, entertaining, safe and successful Ice Fishing season.  Although it pains me to put my Ice fishing equipment away, I'm excited for the Fly Fishing and open water season to begin.  We shared tons of stories, made lots of new friends and made lots of lifelong memories.  The addition of a couple new Pemberton Fish Finder employees allowed us to accommodate larger corporate groups.  I would also like to thank my Beautiful Wife, Melissa Knowles for answering the phone, emails and coordinating the teams schedules.  Melissa's job is a thankless job, but without her we would not have been nearly as successful as we were.  Our group of Professional Ice Fishing guides took people Ice fishing from all over the World.  It was interesting to say the least to see people walk on to a frozen lake for the first time.  The question arose regularly "Is the ice safe?" my reply was typically it's holding me up, you'll be OK.  Anyone that knows me would know that I'm a big boy, that ways in at 280 LBS and most of my clients weigh roughly half of what I do.  It was amazing how many people could not believe that I would be their host for the day after sitting at home watching our fishing videos on YouTube.  They soon found out that I was a normal dude with an exceptional ability to catch fish and put my clients on fish too.  Poor James in the picture below was one of those guys that was star shocked but a quick hug brought him back down to earth.  In the video below we announce the end of the Ice fishing season and share a few fond memories from the past Ice fishing season.  Not many people know this but I'm a Rapper and the tune in the video is non other than Brad Knowles himself.  Lets just say I'm not going to give up on my day job anytime soon.  Our next Ice fishing will commence December 15th, 2016.  Call Melissa today and Book your spot for Ice fishing on the up coming season.  https://pembertonfishfinder.com/ ['Ice fishing', 'Pemberton Fish Finder', 'hardwater fishing', 'Brad Knowles', 'Things to do in Whistler', 'things to do in British Columbia', 'winter activity', 'things to do in Pemberton']

Port Huron Water Intake, Fish How many of you know where Port Huron Michigan is? Before the 1920's, it was a happening place. Our history was relevant. You can't open up a Great Lakes shipping book and NOT read about Port Huron. Lately, things have been stale. BIG things have been announced like casinos, bridge plaza expansions, and some others, only to have them fizzle away. While we were all chipping away at survival and possibilites, mother nature has been delivering gifts to the area. At first..., we thought she was delivering a social disease in the form of those communist zebra mussels. Then it was the Gobies, courtesy of the venerial nature of international shipping. The Great Lakes met the challenges and some of the side effects are clearer waters and a new source food for some of our species creating greater sizes and numbers. Because I dive these waters exclusively, I was able to watch the changes happening before my eyes. That's when I came to the conclusion that we could build some things to take advantage of these changes. Believe me, I figured out the structure before I ever figured out how to build it. I know how to build it now, and quite ingeniously too. It's called Below the Blue . The foundation of the structure is a 45' wide x 15' tall window looking into our NEW St. Clair River. We will see and hear the many things that are moving through our river. Now, the challenge is gathering groups that need a home. Fishing, shipping, diving, marine biology, etc. to start a snowball effect of excitement and energy to build their new home. Some wealthy "1 percenter" is out there with the capital to build this. You may even know one. You may even BE one. It will be THE place to travel for year round healthy entertainment, and an escape from winter. It's at an international border crossing, it will take advantage of NATURAL resources FREE, and the people needed to build it are already here. Get me an audience with YOUR 1 percenter, all of your 1 percenters. It's to your advantage!

Lake Erie Ice Fishing Trip March 7,  2014 This is another great trip to Lake Erie to ice fish for some big walleye.  Our group is still fairly new to Lake Erie ice fishing so we are still learning.  Safety is the main thing. The ice was in great shape at 20-22 inches thick.  We ran out 8-10 miles towards West Sister island.  The morning bite was very slow with only a couple of fish caught.  We kept moving and finally got into some fish around mid day.  The bite really heated up from 2-4 pm.  We each kept our limit of eater size walleye.  We caught several larger fish up to almost 10 pounds. ['ice fishing', 'walleye', 'Lake Erie', 'Dime Daughter', 'Sebile Vibrato', 'ice fishing lake erie', 'ice fishing walleye', 'fishing', 'jigging']

Walleye Ice Fishing Red Lake MN January 8-11, 2015 Walleye fishing on the huge Red Lake is a unique experience. It's divided into an upper and lower portion, and only about half of the upper portion is accessible to most anglers. The other two thirds is part of a Reservation. It gets a good amount of fishing pressure, and 30+ fish days aren't uncommon. The daily bag limit is 3 walleyes, and fish between 17"-26" must be released immediately.

Red Lake Ice Fishing -- 4 man walleye limit We had heard the bite was still on at Red Lake so we decided to pull the wheel houses up and try fishing for some walleye. Most of the fish we caught that were on camera are towards the end of the video. We set up in 12 feet of water and although the fishing wasn't on fire, it was steady through out the day and night. This was enough to fill a four man limit of walleye over the course of a day and a half. Nearly every walleye we caught were keepers except for the smaller ones. The biggest one caught was 19".

Ice fishing for pike using the Marcum VS380 I don't have means to record directly from the cam yet, so I just recorded the image from the screen onto my cell phone....hence the quality.  The pike were very finicky this day...just couldn't get them to strike.  I was using a Scad purchased from Superstore 'painted' to look like a perch. All rigged up on a homemade quick-strike rig.  I eventually abandoned this method, switched to buck-tail jigs tipped with smelt and finally went to spoons. ['pike', 'ice fishing', 'underwater camera', 'marcum']

Saranac Lake man shows passion on the ice in popular fishing derby! The Colby Classic Ice Fishing Derby in Saranac Lake, NY has been around for 29 years. The anglers who participate do so with a passion not just for hooking the big one but also for the love of the sport and being one with nature. I had the opportunity to follow one man's journey through the popular two-day community event.  In researching the story I found a quote from American writer William Tapply that sums up the experience. He states, "I've gone fishing thousands of times in my life, and I have never once felt unlucky or poorly paid for those hours on the water."   The Colby Classic remains as vibrant as it was when it began 29 years ago. It will most certainly evoke a sense of community for many years to come. It is organized each year by The Saranac Lake Fish and Game Club.

Rainbow Trout Underwater Ice Fishing GoPro Hero The fish are not always where you expect to find them.  This day I noticed I wasn't getting any bites near the bottom and I saw a lot of aquatic bugs right under the ice.  So I started to jig right under the ice over ten feet of water and looked down the hole.  To my surprise fish were swimming right under my hole checking out the bait and even striking at it once in a while.  This was pretty cool so I drilled a couple of holes and stuck my GoPro Down to see what I could catch.  There was lots of snow on ice and this was late in the day so the lighting isn't the best but still pretty interesting to see their near ice behavior in the winter.  The ones I caught and filleted were full of these water bugs and sticklebacks.

Best Rainbow Trout Ice fishing TIPS with Jaw Jacker Fishing Hermitage Park Pond for Rainbow Trout under the ice is always something I like to try when home for Christmas.  This is late in the season for these rainbows and sometimes they aren't very active as the oxygen levels in the lake fall.  I got out to the lake around sunrise although it was cloudy so I didn't see it.  I wasn't getting any hits in a usual spot so I moved across the pond to another spot.  Right around noon I had the first hit on the Jaw Jacker and lost him at the hole.  Lowered back down and soon had a nice 16 inch rainbow.  I underestimated in the video at 14 inches.  After that the bites were on and off.  But must have had 15 fish on the line and hits on the Jaw Jacker but only ended up getting four on the ice.  It was a lot of fun.  Check out the video for all the details and how you can catch more fish at Hermitage Park pond.  Get out there before they winterkill.  The action was fast and furious in the afternoon.

Water Proof Samsung Galaxy S5 Survives Extreme Underwater Conditions Samsung Galaxy S5 Phone rescued after I dropped it through a hole in the ice while fishing into 20 feet of water.  The phone was dropped in around 3 pm and spent the night on the lake bottom.  The next morning we arrived with all sort of poles and nets to retrieve the phone.  After 2 hours of trying we were able to net the phone.  After sitting in the ice cold water for 21 hours not only was the phone still on it had 74% battery life.  This was an epic rescue and catch.  We were pretty excited to have actually retrieved the phone and even more excited that it was still working.  If you're a fisherman and prone to dropping things in the water you may want to look into getting and S5.

Understanding Walleye Underwater Behavior Ice Fishing the Jaw Jacker Underwater Walleye Behavior while ice fishing using a Jaw Jacker.  To get this video I just sent a GoPro down to watch what would go on  while I had a Jaw Jacker set up.  This was a super slow day.  So much so we didn't think there were many fish around.  That was until I reviewed the footage and saw many fish swim by without even giving notice to the bait.  Then there were those that would just come in for a look and others that would just nudge the bait.  Finally did get one to inhale the bait on the Jaw Jacker.  Learned a very important lesson that on these slow neutral days a minnow on the bottom was more likely to attract a bit.  So the next  trip my uncle headed out with a jig and minnow, then a few inches of line and a single hook below.  Attach a minnow to both and send down.  Let the bottom minnow lay on the bottom.  The next time he went out the fish were in a similar mood, but the jaw jacker caught 90% of the fish and all of them were on that bottom minnow on the bottom.  So this really is a highly effective method of Jaw Jacker fishing for walleye especially on those tough days. Give it a try and don't forget to comment below, LIKE and SUBSCRIBE!

Shocking Underwater Jaw Jacker Northern Pike Friday the 13th Underwater Video of the Jaw Jacker in action on a very tough day of fishing March Friday the 13th.  The weather was beautiful warm, calm and sunny but the fish were in an ultra negative mood.  So much so we thought there weren't any fish in the area from watching our MarCum.  Turns out there were lots of fish in our area and instead of our jigging action pulling fish in to the bait it was actually turning them off before they were even seen on the  sonar.  This is where the Jaw Jacker's were excelling.  I learned a few things from this video.  The pike were getting off because I had a light line on the rod and reel so I think the monofilament was stretching too much to get a good hook set.  Also since the fish were in such a negative mood they wouldn't even fight after the hook set so they would create their own slack and just spit the hook.  So on slow days it really does call for a Jaw Jacker rigged with braided line, a good stiff rod and loaded with lots of tension.  That way the fish will hopefully still be there when you get to the rod on those slow fishing days.  Check out the video I learned a lot from watching it after and hope you do too.

Justin's Lake Champlain Lake Trout Jan 31, 2010.wmv We took our Grandson, Justin, ice fishing for perch.  We hadn't really gotten started when Justin hooked this Lake Trout in the eight to ten pound class.  He didn't want anymore to do with it so I finished the job. We didn't weigh or measure the fish so we could release it right away.  Four pound test line on a light jigging rod.  Fish H8 me. ['ice fishing', 'lake trout', 'lake champlain', 'fish h8 me']

Phantom-Fishing by DJI Phantom 3 ( Drone Fishing ) for Fish that FIGHT BACK !! Something I've wanted to try for some time became possible without the question:  "Is this legal??"  Stopped by my friend's private Trout Pond for a try at "Drone Fishing" or "Phantom Fishing" with my DJI Phantom 3 Pro Multi-Rotor "Flying Camera". The fish were more cautious than I thought they would be as I believe the Flying UAV overhead probably resembled the Ospreys and Eagles that take shots at them from time to time. There was a certain amount of risk in not knowing if the Phantom could lift even the smallest fish at 12+ inches.  Even more risky was the fact that there were some 5 and 8 pound hold-over "Lunkers" in the pond too..  The first good strike was from a medium sized Trout that yanked the line and bobber right out of the "Safety" clip.  There was a very real possibility that I would have to dive in the pond to save the Phantom as there were no boats that could be used to save the Phantom if I hooked "Troutzilla". I searched for other Drone Fishing videos but could only find several with a minnow that looked like it was already dead and a few with palm sized or smaller Sunfish, Bluegills or similar fish that seem to give up when you lift them out of the water..  I wanted to see some REAL fishing with fish that you would actually consider having for dinner...

Maumee River Walleye Run 2015 This video is some of the fish that I caught at the walleye run this year (2015). I was only able to fish 4/11 and 4/12. I had a blast catching them even though you snag them way more than you catch legal. I went with a great group of guys. You also meet some pretty friendly people while in the water. My biggest was just under 6 pounds. My brother pulled out a jack that was just over 7. In total the group caught 22 keepers. I was using a Abu Ora Sx spinning real along with a Shimano Crucial Medium fast rod.

Fishing the Lower Niagara with Rich Brouwer Richard Brouwer kindly took me out for a morning on the lower Niagara River and shared some of his fishing knowledge with me.

Rich landed way more fish than I show here. I lost two more fish than I show here. Sniffly noses warning - sorry.

Belwood Lake Fishing Like to find where to fish? I mean a good one, try fish at Belwood lake.   Belwood Lake is located at 8282 Wellington County Rd. 18, RR #4, Fergus, ON N1M 2W5. It was created in 1942 with the construction of the Shand Dam, the first dam in Canada built solely for water control purposes. Conservation area visitors can stand on the top deck of the dam and see the vista of the Grand River valley below. A stairway along the face of the dam allows visitors to walk down to its base. The flow from the dam is used to generate hydroelectricity. The 12 km-long lake (7.5 miles) offers excellent boating, fishing and water-skiing, while a small spring-fed quarry offers an ideal spot for people to cool off on hot summer days.  Enjoy your Belwood lake fishing! ['Belwood lake fishing', 'belwood lake', 'belwood lake fish', 'where to fish in Ontario', 'where to fish in Toronto', 'Fishing (TV Genre)']

Killer Spinner Rig Searching for Perch and Walleye When you're at a new lake and don't really know where to begin it is a good idea to go with trolling.  You cover ground with a very effective presentation searching for active fish on the prowl.  One of my favorite methods to troll or drift with the wind is using a bottom bouncer and spinner rig. Most conventional spinner rigs have on spinner with some beads and a float.  We've taken it another step to create the killer rig with three large spinner blades and multiple floats.  For some reason the perch love this set up as well as Big walleye.  So if you've never used a spinner rig bottom bouncing before this video is for you.

How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing. How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing. How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing.  On of the most consistent way to catch a meal of rainbow trout from a stocked pond is to use floating dough baits for trout.  I prefer to use the Berkley products Powerbait and Gulp Trout Dough.  Both of these baits float well and produce a lot of fish.  My all round favorite tested in several lakes seems to be Gulp Chunky Cheese in Garlic scent or flavor.  The trout go crazy after this bait and if presented well you will be into some great fishing.  You will need a 3/8 oz sliding egg sinker, a barrel swivel, 4 pound Berkley Vanish fluorocarbon line and a size 18 treble hook.  Very the leader length from 12 inches to 4 feet for best results.  I usually start with a leader around 18 inches long.  Roll up a ball of bait and cover the treble hook.  Then launch it out into the water gently so not to lose the bait.  Then the waiting begins and if everything is right with fish in the area you wont have long to wait.  So go catch some rainbow trout today at a local pond or lake and give this set up a try.

The Return Of The Salmon 2016 The Return Of The Salmon: An Award-winning Documentary Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/returnofthesalmon Website: http://www.returnofthesalmon.com  Each summer, millions of salmon conclude their lifelong odyssey in Alaskan rivers. It is salmon that bring life to their natal streams. While swimming upstream, they stop feeding. From the forest to the animals that live there, salmon provide essential nutrients and food. Many species harvest the seasonal bounty, including bears, wolves, eagles and ravens. This is a journey no salmon survive, for once they have spawned, they die. Each year we catch millions of salmon from the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska. Salmon support thousands of Alaskan livelihoods. They are central to the Alaskan way of life. Salmon are the lifeblood of Alaska.  Alaskan cruise tourists can choose wildlife watching as a cruise excursion when they come ashore. Watching bears catching salmon is one of the most popular things to do in Alaska for tourists. Most tourists take a cruise up the Inside Passage and disembark at the Southeast Alaska stops of Sitka, Juneau or Ketchikan. Tour operators offer popular brown bear viewing excursions to nearby "ABC" Islands. Admiralty, Baranof and Chichagof Islands are famous for their grizzly bear inhabitants.   There is one animal that draws the most significant amount of tourists from the Lower 48 to Southeast Alaska.  Each summer thousands of fishermen make their pilgrimage to fish the rivers of the Tongass National Forest. The Pacific salmon returning from the ocean on their spawning migration are the catch of the day.   Five species of Pacific salmon return to Alaska each summer: the pink or “humpy”, chum, coho, sockeye and Chinook. Each year commercial fishing fleets catch close to 50 million salmon. 120,000 sports fishermen catch 1 million salmon as they return to the rivers of Southeast Alaska. These statistics help us understand the significance of the salmon run to the local economy. Without the return of the salmon, one of nature's great events, Alaska would be a different place.   During Tim Plowden's trip to the Alaska he realised it was all about the return of the salmon. He decided to create this short natural history documentary about the final stage of the salmon’s life cycle. Their migration to the waters of their birth to spawn is an epic story.   A score composed and performed by Christel Veraart accompanies Tim Plowden’s footage. New narration in this 2016 version is by seasoned voice over professional Kevin O'Connell.  Awards: "Best Of Alaska Award" 2015 Alaska International Film Awards; "Award of Merit"  2015 IndieFEST Film Awards.  Official Selections:  2015 British Documentary Film Festival; 2015 International Kuala Lumpur Eco Film Festival; Voices from the Waters International Traveling Film Festival in India; and just announced - 2016 Wildlife Conservation Film Festival in New York!

EASY CATCH FISHING ROD For more information go to http://www.easycatchfishingrod.com (Full description below - click Show More)  The easy catch rod does all the work!  The combination of a spring loaded hinge and a balancing force provided by the indicator assembly enhances the efficiency of the fishing rod. The spring loaded hinge and the pivoting arm allow the fish to drag the bait downward.  This allows the fish to pull the fishing line freely for a distance of approximately 1 foot, and when the arm member reaches the end of its range of movement, then the fish's pulling on the line draws the line taut which is usually enough to set the hook in the fish's mouth. The reflector tilts upward in unison with the folding of the arm into a near vertical orientation to indicate the likelihood that a fish has been caught. For typical ice fishing, a fishing line rated at 50 lb strength has been found to be suitable. Notice: For deep sea fishing a line of 80 to 100lb test is recommended.  When the user is ready to pack up, he or she simply reels or winds the fishing line up and pushes down the arm member so that it folds against the mast. For even more compact storage, the indicator assembly can be removed. Advantageously, no tools are required for assembly or disassembly.

Great Lakes Ice Fishing, Lake Erie, Small Boat Harbor for Perch Doing a little ice fishing on 2/18/13 in the Small Boat Harbor at Buffalo, New York.  Air temp was 13 degrees in the morning increasing to about 30 degrees in the afternoon.  Skies were partly cloudy with 10mph wind.  The perch were hitting all day long, ranging from 6" to 10.25".  In this particular video, my dad misses on his first few hits but then catches two fish at the same time on the same line.  He uses a common setup consisting of two eagle claw hooks tied about 10" apart with a sinker on the bottom.  He balances his pole on a can so that he can see the fish hit.  The bait is emerald shiners purchased from Big Catch bait and tackle on Niagara Street.  We kept about 10 fish that day and fried them up for a nice little snack the following day.

Bass Fishing Hello everyone and welcome to another video. In this video we are on Lough-borough Lake targeting both large and small mouth bass. It was a extremely over cast day which made for darker water but we found the fishing to actually be pretty good. We landed well over 15 fish and got 3 very nice sized ones with our biggest being 3.3lbs. Thank you guys so much for watching and make sure to subscribe.  Weather- Very over cast with temperatures ranging from 14 - 17 degrees. We had little burst of rain through out the day but nothing major.

Funny fishing stories. Fish attacks girl and she makes a scene. Who wins this fish vs. girl battle? who loses the fish attack? I took my 14 year old daughter to Michigan for the 4th of July weekend in 2010 and she decided she wanted to try fishing. The fish her cousin had caught was a whopping 2.5 inches and she was scared to death of this thing. She was freaking out when it flopped towards her, not only one time but twice.

FISHING ROD For more information go to  www.easycatchfishingrod.com      The easy catch rod does all the work!    The combination of a spring loaded hinge and a balancing force provided by the indicator assembly enhances the efficiency of the fishing rod. The spring loaded hinge and the pivoting arm allow the fish to drag the bait downward.    Thos allows the fish to pull the fishing line freely for a distance of approximately 1 foot, and when the arm member reaches the end of its range of movement, then the fish's pulling on the line draws the line taut which is usually enough to set the hook in the fish's mouth. The reflector tilts upward in unison with the folding of the arm into a near vertical orientation to indicate the likelihood that a fish has been caught. For typical ice fishing, a fishing line rated at 50 lb strength has been found to be suitable. Notice: For deep sea fishing a line of 80 to 100lb test is recommended.    When the user is ready to pack up, he or she simply reels or winds the fishing line up and pushes down the arm member so that it folds against the mast. For even more compact storage, the indicator assembly can be removed. Advantageously, no tools are required for assembly or disassembly.

Icy Strait Point Halibut Fishing Halibut Fishing - Icy Strait Point  Board a cabin cruiser and embark on the ultimate fishing excursion to the rich waters of Icy Strait.  After receiving a safety orientation, it's an approximate 20-30 minute ride to the fishing grounds, where you will have approximately 2.5 hours of fishing. The waters of Icy Strait are nutrient rich, making conditions ideal for angling. The Icy Strait region is also known for its abundant marine life, so be sure to bring your camera and plenty of film for once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunities. Chances for catching fish are good, however not guaranteed.  Minimum age to participate is 6 years old; children under 13 years old are required to wear a life vest while onboard the vessel. Deck or rubber soled shoes must be worn on the boat. Bring warm layered, waterproof clothing. Alaska State Law requires a valid one-day fishing license, which may be purchased for $20 before the start of your tour. Custom packing is available for an additional fee. If you land a fish and choose not to release it immediately you are responsible for processing and shipping the fish home. Please read and understand the information provided by the tour operator before catching any fish. Shipping is not available outside the US. We regret that fish cannot be stored on board the ship.

Indulging in his wildlife and nature photography, he captured beautiful photos of wood ducks, nature scenes, but mainly, white-tailed deer.As an established cabinet maker, he has built kitchen cabinets, antique replicas, and cedar canoes.     An avid trout fisherman for 40 years, he ties his own flies. He has assisted the DEC in reclaiming lakes and ponds by reintroducing the native, Windfall strain of brook trout.     Winter months he combined his passions by designing his own fishing net for canoes and float tubes. His new concept of fly fishing net combines materials and construction into a fully laminated (both handle and hoop) work of art with up to 5 laminates. He has experimented with numerous exotic and local woods for durability and beauty, such as, blood cherry, ash, red cherry, walnut, padauk, poplar, and hickory. When laminated properly, the contrast of woods make for a striking and uniquie fishing net which most customers prefer to simply mount in their dens, but are practical and durable for lake and pond fishing.

Whistler British Columbia Helicopter Fly Fishing Trips It's Heli Fishing Season in British Columbia Canada.  The Snow has finally left the shoreline of the Alpine lakes surrounding both Whistler and Pemberton, BC.  The water temperature is hovering around 55°f, which is perfect for producing aquatic life.  Trout in these Alpine lakes feed very aggressively during the ice free season, which is roughly 5 months long.  These Alpine lakes are typically frozen longer than they are open water.  Evidence of winter looms on the mountain tops throughout the year.  The Alpine meadows are lush and the smell of Alpine flowers is in the air.  As soon as you step out of the Helicopter the thousand smells of alpine air hit you.  The air temperature hovers around 25°c throughout the day and we only fly on sunny days, so make sure you bring your sunscreen. Fishing Alpine lakes around Whistler BC with Helicopters These Alpine lakes are absolutely full of hungry Rainbow Trout and Cutthroat Trout.  We have nearly 10 Alpine lakes that we visit with Helicopters surrounding both Whistler and Pemberton, BC.  Every alpine lake we fish have different spectacular settings and they range in size and flight time.  Trout in our Alpine lakes can grow upwards of 20" depending on the lake.  Most Alpine lakes see Trout ranging in size from 12" - 18" and weighing as much as 3 pounds.  Although the fish are not giant be prepared to catch lots of fish and be surrounded by the most spectacular views Earth has to offer.  Ever client that visits these alpine lakes refer to them as Paradise. Paradise and hungry Trout await. First and foremost, make sure you bring lots of Batteries and storage for your cameras.  In every direction are spectacular views, alpine flowers, deep blue water and snow tipped mountains.  Be assured that you will be the only one at the lake for the day because of there remoteness.  All of our Alpine lakes are located at 5000 feet in elevation or greater.  The air is crisp and clean with the hint of Alpine flowers.  The helicopter ride will take you through the mountains, glaciers and lush forests below.  Be prepared for helicopter fishing trip of a lifetime.

Adams River Sockeye Run 2010 Best watched at 720p. Sockeye salmon return in huge numbers to the Adams River to spawn, this run is thought to be the best since 1913 with an estimated 30 million sockeye returning.    This video was filmed using a Canon 5DmkII, GoPro Hero HD, and a Sony HVR-Z1u.   I should mention the GoPro Hero HD is in the EyeOfMine housing which has a flat lens port. The standard GoPro housing has a curved lens port that really distorts the image when underwater.    Oh, and as a note, no salmon were disturbed in the filming of underwater shots - they told me so!

Moraine Lake, Alberta Canada Moraine Lake is a glacially-fed lake in Banff National Park, 14 km outside the Village of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada. It is situated in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, at an elevation of approximately 6,183 feet. The lake has a surface area of .5 square km.  The lake, being glacially fed, does not reach its crest until mid to late June. When it is full, it reflects a distinct shade of blue. The color is due to the refraction of light off the rock flour deposited in the lake on a continual basis.  Filmed with a Canon EOS 650D (Rebel T4i) in August.

Moment de magie avec les saumons Saumon frayant dans la Rivière Ste-Anne, Parc de la Gaspésie Les étapes de reproduction du saumon  Après avoir passé de 1 à 3 ans en haute mer, les saumons reviennent dans leur rivière natale. Ils arborent une couleur argentée qui va s'assombrir durant l'été. Ils cessent alors de se nourrir et cherchent à remonter leur rivière jusqu'à l'endroit où ils sont nés. Vers la mi-octobre, les saumons s'apprêtent à quitter les fosses de la rivière pour se diriger vers les frayères. Ils y retrouveront une eau peu profonde, un courant plus rapide et un fond parsemé de gravier. Puis, un bon matin, la température de l'eau s'abaisse vers les 6 °C. Les saumons commencent alors l'exploration des frayères. Les couples se forment progressivement et il est alors facile de distinguer les mâles, leur mâchoire inférieure étant garnie d'un imposant crochet pointé vers le haut. Tandis que les femelles repèrent les lieux propices à la ponte, seuls les mâles les plus agressifs réussiront à défendre continuellement leur territoire autour de chacune d'elles. Les autres mâles tenteront inlassablement de s'approcher des femelles. Ils s'exposeront alors à de vives poursuites de la part des mâles dominants. À l'occasion, on peut même observer des contacts brutaux. Les saumons qui ont passé une seule année en mer, les madeleineaux, sont plus petits et presque invariablement des mâles. À l'endroit qu'elle a choisi, une femelle creusera plus d'un nid de 10 à 20 cm de profondeur. D'un mouvement vif, contorsionné et rapide de sa queue, elle soulève le gravier qui est ainsi lavé par le courant. Dans la frayère, vous pouvez reconnaître ces regroupements de nids à la couleur jaune pâle du gravier. Au moment de frayer, mâle et femelle se placent côte à côte. Le mâle tremble de tout son corps, se tend et ouvre très grand sa gueule. La femelle, stimulée, en fait autant. Les tremblements s'estompent, la femelle pond ses œufs et le mâle les féconde en laissant sa laitance s'échapper.  La fraie terminée, les saumons peuvent redescendre à la mer. Certains auront l'occasion de venir frayer une ou deux fois. Et tôt au printemps, l'éclosion commence...

NOT A LONELY PLANET Earth is definitely NOT A LONELY PLANET, I shot  this video in late April 2010 and all the sounds were recorded at the time of shooting. There is the sound of birds, many of them migratory which have recently arrived for nesting, the sound of kids and parents along with the constant noise of city life. Definitely not lonely.      But we are on the way to making our planet not only lonely but very quiet with the constant and accelerated destruction of habitat and species. The oil spill in the gulf is just the latest but by no means the only act of destruction that we are thrusting on the planet. In Central America there are Canadian companies mining for gold, but before they could access the gold the local residents had to be forcibly evicted. Some were killed by the Military. Mining today is not about a small hole in the ground. The entire mountain is laid waste and the inherent pollution is harming the people living in the area. Coal mining in the USA accomplishes the same results and in Alberta it's the Tar Sands.    We slaughter seals in Canada for the fashion industry, but Europe has barred the importation of seal products so the Canadian Government (not representing the majority view) will take the European Union too court. In Alaska they shoot wolves from airplanes so hunters will have more trophy game like moose and caribou to kill.  Japan slaughters dolphins in the Cove by the tens of thousands, kills whales for research and in the open seas sharks are being killed to extinction for their fins. In Africa bush meat or wild game is not only hard to find due to poaching but most of the animals have parasites harmful to the people who eat them.    Its a nasty little world we have created in the name of progress, and this is just the tip of the iceberg which we also won't have for long due to global warming.    DOES ANYBODY CARE?

Tri-Creeks Experimental Watershed Study George Sterling summarizes 30 years of research at the Tri-Creeks Experimental Watershed in west-central Alberta, south of Hinton, Alberta. Thirty years ago logging was done quite differently in Alberta. Specifically, the experimental watershed study looked at clear cutting and logging along riparian areas using paired watersheds monitored from 1965 to 1987.   After road construction and logging, in spite of limited data and quality control issues, some interpretation of fish survival and water quality could be made. Some limited monitoring in the 1990's and then in the 2000's completed the monitoring. George points to temperature modeling in streams and flow increases during incubation as techniques for the future. He also identifies encroachment by non-native species (brook trout) as a forestry management issue.   George Sterling is Senior Fisheries Biologist with Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, at Edson, Alberta. His presentation was part of the 2013 fRI Water Program Workshop.

Deepwater Cisco Stocking Off the USGS Research Vessel KAHO http://gallery.usgs.gov/videos/866  The USGS Tunison Lab of Aquatic Science (Cortland, NY) and the USGS Lake Ontario Biological Station (Oswego, NY), which are both part of the USGS Great Lakes Science Center, collaborated each year from 2012-2014 in the release of deepwater cisco ("bloater") off of the USGS research vessel KAHO in the Lake Ontario waters off of Oswego, New York, in late fall. Last observed in the wild in the mid-1980s, bloater was a critical native component to the Lake Ontario deepwater fish community, providing healthy prey fish to lake trout and integrating energy transfer from the lake's deep waters to its surface.

USGS Bottom Trawl Sampling on Lake Erie http://gallery.usgs.gov/videos/966  The U.S. Geological Survey Great Lakes Science Center has conducted lake-wide surveys of the fish community in Lake Erie since the 1960s. The resulting data on relative abundance, size, and age of fishes are used by state and provincial agencies to manage Lake Erie fish stocks. This video shows bottom trawl sampling during June 2015.

Fraser River Sockeye and Sea Lice : Response by Marine Harvest http://www.marineharvest.ca  A video produced by Raincoast Research in 2008 attempted to link sea lice infections on sockeye salmon with salmon farms. Unfortunately, this video lacks scientific objectivity and contains many errors and omissions.  Some of these errors and omissions are:  1. Sea lice are a natural ocurring parasite hosted by many wild fish in the ocean throughout the year. 2. All salmon farms in British Columbia are highly regulated and adhere to strict sea lice management protocols. 3. During the filming, wild Pacific herring were present and hosting millions of sea lice - specifically the 'Caligus' species.  4. The main species identified on the juvenile sockeye in the video are 'Caligus', the same species found on the wild Pacific herring present at the time of the sample. 5. The main species of sea lice typically identified on farmed salmon is 'Lepeophtheirus salmonis' - a different species than is on the juvenile sockeye. 6. Salmon farms near the sample area were hosting less than .01 sea lice per farmed salmon at the time the video was taken. There were zero egg bearing female lice at the time the video was shot. 7. The juvenile sockeye in this video may not actually be from the Fraser River, as they are too small. 8. No mortality (due to sea lice) of juvenile salmon have been recorded with this size of fish (larger than 1 gram). 9. This same environmental group (Raincoast Research)was invited to salmon farms to witness sea lice monitoring samples during the spring of 2008. They attended two separate samples at two different farms, but refused to witness the counts (zero sea lice were found on 120 farmed salmon that were sampled).  The following video highlights a sea lice sample taken during the same time period at a farm site next to the sampling area chosen by Raincoast Research. (3:38)  2011 UPDATE - The 2010 return of Fraser River Sockeye was the highest return in over 100 years (30 million +). The 2010 adults were juveniles in 2008 - the same juveniles rumoured to be "at risk" from salmon farms by Raincoast Research and others.   http://www.farmfreshsalmon.org/record-number-sockeye-salmon-return-bc  To learn more about sea lice and fish health management at Marine Harvest Canada visit http://www.marineharvest.ca ['Fraser', 'River', 'sockeye', 'wild', 'salmon', 'farmed', 'fish', 'aquaculture', 'B.C.', 'british', 'columbia', 'twyla', 'roscovich', 'Alexandra', 'Morton', 'sea', 'lice']

Bald Eagles & Salmon Spawning It's salmon spawning season in British Columbia's beautiful Lower Mainland, which means that bald eagles are sure to follow.    This video was shot right here where we live and at Weaver Creek Spawning Channel just down the street, as well as at the nearby Inch Creek Fish Hatchery, where Coho Salmon are raised.    The instincts of Pinks, Chum and Sockeye Salmon drive them to swim upstream to spawn, and they are everywhere around here this time of year.  We're right at the confluence of the Harrison River and the Chehalis River, just upstream from the Fraser River, and all we have to do is stroll down to the waterfront at the end of the property to watch them spawn.    You can see that we're nestled into the beautiful BC Coast Mountains.  This time of year, the water level is so low that we can walk right out onto the flats, where the salmon are spawning in water that isn't even a foot deep.  If you watched our canoeing videos from earlier this year, when the water was up, you wouldn't even recognize the place now.    There are already dozens of eagles perched in the trees on the mountain across the street from us.  We've counted as many as 35 flying overhead at a time, and you can hear their distinctive call overhead all the time.    Two weeks from now, the 16th annual Fraser Valley Bald Eagle Festival begins.  Our location is one of the prime spots for viewing eagles, which come from all over to get their fill of salmon. We're eagerly anticipating the arrival of hundreds, even thousands of bald eagles over the next couple of weeks.

Smokin' fish Trailer Cory Mann is a quirky Tlingit businessman hustling to make a dollar in Juneau Alaska.  He gets hungry for smoked salmon, nostalgic for his childhood, and decides to spend a summer smoking fish at his family's traditional fish camp. The unusual story of his life and the untold history of his people interweave with the process of preparing traditional food as he struggles to pay his bills, keep the IRS off his back, and keep his business afloat.  By turns tragic, bizarre, or just plain ridiculous, Smokin' Fish, tells the story of one man's attempts to navigate the messy zone of collision between the modern world and an ancient culture.

2015 Aquatic Research Laboratory Salmon Release - Lake Superior State University Lake Superior State University President Tom Pleger dons academic regalia to sweep some of the 40,000 Atlantic salmon released into the St. Mary's river in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., on June 2. This 1,718-gallon tank - one of six involved in the release - held about 5,000 fingerlings that were collected as eggs in the fall of 2013. LSSU students, staff and alums joined city officials and regional media to witness the event at the university's riverfront Aquatic Research Laboratory. Along with a variety of Great Lakes research projects conducted with many partners, the LSSU lab has worked with the Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources every year since 1987 to raise Atlantic salmon, which are caught by anglers in nearly all of the Great Lakes.

The knots in my video are variations of two knots that are commonly used for fly fishing. I was shown those knots while I was fly fishing at the 2006 Commonwealth Fly Fishing Championships in North Wales. It's a very practical and useful knot for times when your fingers are frozen and numb or for people who have poor vision, finger dexterity or arthritis...

Man uses drone to catch a large fish in a lake An incredible video has emerged from Canada of a man using a drone to catch a large fish in a lake.  The footage, filmed on Lake Champlain near Montreal on Friday, shows YouTuber Viva Frei challenging himself to catch a fish in a "real body of water" after seeing people using drones to catch fish in small ponds.  He later wrote online: "I had seen a couple of guys 'catching' fish with their drones, using worms on a hook in some small pond, but where is the challenge in that?   "So I decided to try and catch a fish the real way - by trolling a lure on a real body of water."  "I tied some fishing line to my drone, attached a jitterbug (a topwater lure), and set out to try and make internet history," he continued.  "Truthfully, I did not expect anything to happen because I had tried a few times before, and just sputtered around until my battery went dead, but this time, on Lake Champlain, not only did I succeed, but I hooked the biggest smallmouth bass of my life.   "After I hooked it and managed to land it, I ran it to my wife for a quick photo op, and then ran it back to the water to release it.   "It swam off the enjoy the day, and I ran off and will spend the next ten years of my life talking about this - It was EPIC!"

ROE HERRING FISHERY OPENS MARCH 6 TH 2012 * LAMBERT CHANNEL PACIFIC COAST CANADA Ebb tide on a nearly full moon. Presented in natural, commercial and industrial sound. The West Coast herring spawn peaks in early March each year. Mini documentary version.             Learn about this fishery @ : http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/344588.pdf    Gill netters, herring skiffs, packers and support vessels gathered and strung out from the Comox Bar to Henry Point in Baynes Sound and Ford Cove in Lambert Channel deploying their gear in extremely favourable conditions under the auspices of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. This 11 minute video was shot over an 80 minute period at sundown from various locations on the eastern shore of Denman Island. For the most part, Hornby Island is the background.     "Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) is a pelagic species which occurs in inshore and offshore waters of the North Pacific. In the eastern Pacific, herring are found from Baja California to the Beaufort Sea in Alaska.    Herring mature and recruit to the spawning stock primarily between ages three and five. Within this range, age-at-recruitment tends to increase with latitude. Adult males and females migrate from the open ocean to sheltered bays around November or December, although in the far north of the range, these dates may be somewhat later.  Conditions that trigger spawning are not altogether clear, but after spending weeks congregating in the deeper channels, both males and females will begin to enter shallower inter-tidal or sub-tidal waters. Preferred spawning locations are sheltered bays and estuaries, commonly on eelgrass or other submerged vegetation. A single female may produce as many as 20,000 eggs in one spawn, however the juvenile survival rate is only about one resultant adult per ten thousand eggs, due to high predation by numerous other species."      { DFO } ['Canada', 'Fishery', 'Lambert', 'Channel', 'Fishing', 'New', 'Pacific', 'Roe', 'spawn', 'milt', 'egg', 'mass', 'species', 'seasonal', 'harvest', 'resource', 'net', 'drum', 'beater', 'marker', 'scotchman', 'buoy', 'skiff', 'fish', 'commercial', 'fishing', 'Herring', 'Clupea', 'pallasii', 'Filongley', 'Tree', 'Island', 'Sandy', 'Komas', 'Bluffs', 'Phipps', 'Point', 'Salish', 'Sea', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Boat', 'BC', 'Ferry', 'Kahloke', 'Shingle', 'Spit', 'Denman', 'East', 'shoreline', 'beach', 'waterfall', 'sunset', 'gulls', 'sea', 'lions', 'catch', 'quota', 'DFO', 'eagle', 'aquamarine', 'ebbing', 'tide', 'full', 'moon', 'Vancouver', 'nature', 'doc', 'report']

Implanting Sonic Tag in Sturgeon U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service biologist Scott Koproski, LSSU Aquatic Research Lab Co-Director Ashley Moerke, and LSSU fisheries student Meghan Kline implant a sonic transponder tag into a sturgeon through a straightforward surgical procedure that's harmless to the fish. Sonic telemetry tags are only implanted into lake sturgeon more than 50 inches (125 cm) long. So far this year, 11 sturgeon caught on the St. Marys River have been large enough for sonic tags. Fish are tracked until they leave the estuary or batteries in the tags expire after four years.

Miramichi Atlantic Salmon & Brook Trout: Upper Oxbow Adventures, New Brunswick Canada Atlantic Salmon Fly and Spey Fishing on the Miramichi River System is all what this type of fishing is written about and much more. Heading off to many of the rivers flowing into the Miramichi is quite an experience with Upper Oxbow Adventures in New Brunswick. With the well-seasoned guides from the lodge, you can walk to three of the lodge pools right from your door, or travel off by a traditional ply-boat and prop, a poled canoe or the newly added jet boats. However, you will venture off to the best salmon spey and fly fishing areas accessible in the region. Fishing more than six rivers, you will have the best opportunity at the majestic Atlantic Salmon. You can join the countless others who have made the Upper Oxbow Adventures their choice for the Atlantic Salmon, Striper and Trout Destination of the Miramichi, I did.

Amazing Trout Underwater Attack Dynamic Lures Dynamic Lures HD Trout crankbait is an excellent trout lure.  In this video i have removed the hooks off three different patterns and tied it up behind my gopro to see how the Rainbow Trout react to the bait.  They seemed to find this bait nearly irresistible.  Watch as they slam it over and over.  Some even hold it in their mouth before dropping it.  Intense follows, hits and multiple fish chasing at a time.  Trout love hardware and this video shows if you are on a new body of water you may just want to tie on a crankbait.  A company sent me a Fisheye Camara Jig to try out. So I was giving it a try. Works ok, but sways back and forth. My own rig seemed to work a little better. I just attach this apparatus to my main line with a heavy rod and 20 pound test, then attach a 8 pound fluoro leader from the camera jig to the hook. I had to play around to get the angles right which was a little tough since I'm using it from a canoe.

Ice Fisherman Drowns in Lenawee County Christine Long Reports:  An ice fisherman drowns after falling into frigid water in Lenawee County.  It happened Thursday on Timber Lake in Cambridge Township, MI, which is northwest of Adrian.  Purple EMT gloves and tire tracks from emergency vehicles are all that's left behind after Thursday's tragic ice fishing outing.  The Lenawee County Sheriff says two men were ice fishing on Timber Lake. You can see the spot where they both fell through the ice.  Investigators say just before noon someone called 9-1-1 after hearing two ice fishermen call for help. When crews arrived they pulled one man out of the water. That man, 52-year-old Gerald Lee Smith from Grass Lake, survived after being Lifelighted to Toledo Hospital. The second ice fisherman, 52-year-old Michael James Shoftsell from Saline, died. Shoftsell was found in 18 feet deep of water.  "It's very sad," says Neal Mahoney, a Sylvania Township Trustee who has a place on nearby Vineyard Lake.  Mahoney planned to ice fish over the weekend but will likely go back home.  "You've got to be out here with the right equipment and make sure that it's safe and right now it's not safe at all," says Mahoney.  Down at Devil's Lake ice fishermen are testing the thickness of the ice and setting up shanties close to shore.  Rod Skow has been fishing Devil's Lake in the winter for nearly three decades. He says the ice is tricky this year.  "This year we thought there'd be more ice than there is already but there's not," says Skow. "Certain areas there's only a couple inches right here, some areas where we are there's six inches."  Fire officials all over Lenawee County say even the most experienced ice fishermen need to remember that no ice is safe ice.  "Make sure that there's, in my opinion, four inches of ice or more which goes again the grain of the old timers," says Addison Fire Chief Tim Shaw. "Personally I wouldn't step on the ice unless there's eight to ten inches." ['ice', 'safety', 'fisherman', 'drowning', 'lenawee county', 'michigan', 'fishing', 'fish', 'shanty']

48" Niagara River Musky bites man and is released. Man needs 9 stitches. Musky fishing can be dangerous. Remember to always wear a glove when handling these fish!     I got on the water at 6:20am and on my first drift hooked and landed (by myself) the biggest musky I've ever caught (48").     With muskies they die so easily you can't take them out of the water for a long time. So musky fishermen have really big nets where you can tie it to the side of the boat and leave the musky in the water swimming around in the giant "live well" net while you get your camera ready for a pic.     I had this one in the net, got my camera ready for a picture and stuck my hand in the water by her head to grab under her gill plate when the fish turned opened her mouth and slashed my hand wide open. As I was bleeding, looking at the muscle in my hand, I knew I had to go to the ER but wanted a pic badly. So I hockey taped up my hand, took her out of the water, took a pic then released the fish. I then had to load my boat back up by myself, get to the ER and get 9 stitches!    I was off the water in 30 minutes. Still, I think it was worth the trouble. I should have been wearing my protective glove! Video of the release, stitches and fish is in this clip.

Ice Fishing on Lake of the Woods, MN Minnesota's woodland-and-lake wilderness is the Northwest Angle. The northernmost point of the continental U.S., it is 150 miles closer to the North Pole than the upper tip of Maine. When conditions are right, you can even see the Northern Lights.  Right now, resorts are closing at the end of their "warm" season. (When I arrived a week ago, it was 34 degrees and snowing!) Owners and operators scatter for quick tropical vacations before "ice in," when temperatures plummet to negative ranges, freezing the 1,679-square mile Lake of the Woods into a solid mass of ice slightly bigger than Rhode Island.  Soon, the "ice road" will emerge as a highway for snowmobiles and bombardiers. Resorts fill up again with winter sports enthusiasts. And the frozen lake becomes prime real estate for ice #fishing.

Fun Day Fly Fishing in Pemberton BC with Tatum Monod Right now the fly fishing in Pemberton, BC is very good.  The Coastal Cutthroat have now made it into the Rivers surrounding Pemberton, and we are now starting to catch them regularly.  Coastal Cutthroat are one of my favorite Trout to fly fish for, simply because they are a very aggressive feeding fish that seldom let an easy meal go by.  Right now the Salmon fry are making there appearance in the Rivers and they are #1 on a Coastal Cutthroat Trout's diet.   Tatum Monod a Pro Skier and avid Fly Fisher. Today I had the Pleasure of fly fishing with Tatum Monod and for those of you that don't know who she is, she is an extreme back country downhill skier.  Tatum is a famous female downhill skier and to be honest I had no idea because she comes across as just a bubbly cute chick with a love for the outdoors.  Some famous people come across as snobs, this was not the case with Tatum.  After chatting with her on the River I quickly found out that she indeed was an avid fly fishing woman.  It did not take long for me to correct what she was doing wrong in our local waters, as you can see from the picture above. How to catch Coastal Cutthroat Trout While fly fishing. As I stated above, Coastal Cutthroat Trout absolutely love eating Salmon fry.  In my experience, no other fly imitates a Salmon fry better than an Improved Moto Minnow.  The more wounded or crippled you make it look the more takes you will receive.  Simply cast this fly up stream slightly and let it swing through the hole, once it swings through the hole start stripping the fly back erratically.  Mix your stripping return with long and short retrieves, make some short and long, fast and slow.  Depending on how fast and deep the River is flowing, you may need to add weight to your leader to get your fly down.  I have found that cutthroat trout hang out near the bottom, they like ledges and structure.  All of these mentioned are great spots to ambush their prey "Salmon Fry".  The Moto Minnow is available at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd in Pemberton at 1380 Birch street.

Ice fishing in Canada with the crew from Hawaii Last Call for Ice fishing in Whistler and Pemberton British Columbia Canada.  The weather has been very favorable for Ice fishing lately and we still have 20" of ice as of March 26th, 2017 but as the days grow in length and the temperature warms the days of ice fishing are numbered.  We figure we have roughly 1 week left of safe Ice for ice fishing before the season is wrapped up.  So, if you want to get out Ice fishing this year it's time to get at it right now.   This is my favorite time of year to ice fish because it can be done in a t-shirt, OK maybe a hoodie. Bucket list fishing trip in Canada This day we spent some time looking for fish, but when we found them it did not take long to put some Rainbow Trout on the ice.  This was Elden's first time ice fishing because where he comes from "Hawaii" there is not any frozen lakes.  This has been on Elden's bucket list for some time and we are very happy to see him catch his first fish while Ice fishing.  There is a small learning curve to ice fishing but once you are dialed in it is a relatively simple style of fishing.  When you are using jigs and lures that the fish you are targeting want to eat, it will make your day a whole lot easier.  This day we were using the famous Zapper ice fishing lure.  When this lure is tipped with a shrimp it suddenly becomes irresistible to Trout.  We highly recommend them when Ice fishing.  The Zapper Ice fishing lure is available at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd. in Downtown Pemberton at 1380 Birch Street.  This ice fishing lure is available in 4 proven fish catching colors, buy yours today.

Tobermory RNLI goes to aid of fishing vessel in F9 gale Volunteer crew from Tobermory RNLI went to the aid of a fishing vessel seven miles to the west of the Isle of Coll in a Force 9 gale with 60mph gusts and 6-8 metre waves. The lifeboat towed the casualty to the Isle of Tiree where the skipper had arranged for the tow to be passed to another fishing boat whilst the lifeboat stood by. Unfortunately that tow rope broke close into shore and the fishing vessel went aground. The lifeboat managed to pass another tow to the casualty in confined waters and recover it to Tobermory.

Centuries of Fish, Seattle's Dynamic Distant Water Fishing Fleet During the latter half of the 19th Century, square-rigged sailing ships propelled by the wind and the strength of men's arms left the Seattle waterfront, bound for the Alaska fishing grounds. At the dawn of the 21st Century, factory ships armed with technology worthy of the Starship Enterprise leave the Seattle waterfront, bound for fishing grounds throughout the North Pacific. For well over 100 years, this Northwest city has been arguably the world's greatest fishing port and the hub of an industry that has played a surprisingly important role in shaping the culture and economy of the Pacific Northwest region.  Centuries of Fish is a documentary videotape that tells the story of an industry that operates largely out of sight and out of the minds of those engaged in shoreside pursuits. For those who know the sea, however, this industry, the last enterprise in the modern world in which men and women hunt a product in the wild, is an enduring source of sustenance and fascination.    © http://johnsabella.com None
