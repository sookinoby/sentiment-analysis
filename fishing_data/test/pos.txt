Humpback Whales doing a little bubble fishing off Juneau, AK 7/24/2013 The highlight of the day (maybe for the entire trip to Alaska). 5-7 Humpback Whales are bubble fishing for Herring off the coast of Juneau, AK. We were on a glacier and whale watching excursion that had a photographer as a guide. He was an expert at photographing whales and also worked as a cameraman for the PBS station in Alaska. We got lucky with our trip out that day as far as the amount of whales out. We saw both Humpback and a few Killer Whales (Orca Whales) that day. To me, this is the only way to really enjoy these majestic animals. ['Humpback Whale (Organism Classification)', 'Juneau (US County)', 'Bubble Fishing', 'Whale Watching']

Best Fishing Charters On Lake Champlain Near Plattsburgh, Willsboro, Port Kent, Essex, Westport Fishing Charter on Lake Champlain- w/ Capt. Mike Tarasavage http://ifishlakechamplain.com - Near Plattsburgh, Willsboro, Essex & all areas on NY side of Lake Champlain. (518) 569-6850.  GUARANTEED FISH... OR YOU DON'T PAY!!!  Capt. Mike is the original JIG master for lake trout on Lake Champlain. Others are chasing him down but they will have a hard time catching the man who has over thirty years experience fishing the lake. There is no more fun to be had with your clothes on than Jiggin' for Lakers on Lake Champlain with Captain Mike.  Bass fishing more your style? Salmon? Doesn't matter. Mike fishes for ANY FISH ANY day unless it is physically impossible. He is somewhat addicted. He's been known to sit by himself in a handmade tent over a small hole in the ice..., wind a howlin, catchin whatever can be caught, while others are stokin the fire and hunkerin down for the winter.  Fishing Lake Champlain is his passion, and frankly his life.  He has a true sportsman's heart to bring the best of fishing to all who seek his knowledge of the lake.  He won't ask for your first born either. Yes he needs to make a living..., yes you probably won't find a better guide to put you on the fish anywhere else on or near Lake Champlain..., yet as of this date, Mike is still probably one of the cheapest fishing charters on the Lake.  He cares more about your time with him and has the genuine goal of providing the best fishing experience to be had on Lake Champlain.  Just check out his website or facebook page. Nearly every day he is posting GIANT fish that his clients pulled in from his secret spots and techniques.  Don't feel like you have to be a pro. to fish with Mike. He charters for all levels from complete novice to tournament pro..., it's all about good times and catchin the next monster. He just can't get enough..., and he wants you to not have to waste your entire trip on wild goose chases. This is an art. And Capt. Mike is a true artist.  He will probably have you reelin in some hogs on your first couple casts. He's that good.   Fishing Charters w/ Capt.

Columbia River Dry Fly Fishing - Little Slough Eddy The stretch of Columbia River from the Canada US border at Waneta past Trail BC to Castlegar BC recently rated in BC's Best Dry Fly Fishing in flyfisherman.com magazine as one of the Top 10 in BC and North America for rainbow trout and dry fly fishing.     On July 5, 2009 friends Randy McCallum and Pat Vlanich both from the sub-division of Sunningdale in Trail BC went fishing on the Columbia River north of Trail BC at a popular fishing spot called Little Slough Eddy. The evening was relaxing and enjoyable, and the fly fishing was spectacular. The evening saw 17 rainbow trout averaging from 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 lbs on the line, 9 rainbow landed to the boat, and a catch limit of 2 each.  Would could be better than that? Life is grand... especially on the Columbia River near Trail, BC Canada. ['trail', 'bc', 'columbia', 'river', 'dry fly flyfisherman.com', 'chamber']
Birkenhead River Fly fishing in Pemberton BC with the Pemberton Fish Finder Birkenhead River Fly fishing in Pemberton BC with the Pemberton Fish Finder.  The Birkenhead River in Pemberton, BC has been fishing very well.  With the arrival of October you can expect to start seeing Coho Salmon.  Sockeye Salmon are now in full spawn mode and the Trout are swimming around cleaning up right after them.  With the salmon spawn in full effect, you can count on egg patterns being the most effective way to dead drift while fly fishing. One thing that will help your chances in landing a nice fish will be adding a strike indicator to your fly line's setup.  This will help you spot any trouts interests in your pattern of choice.  The Birkenhead river offers some of the best fly fishing in BC and the World. Bull trout are the largest trout species you will find in the Birkenhead river at this moment and there are plenty of them to be had.  Rainbow trout are also a beautiful fish to target, so you wont be needing much more than a 6 weight fly rod. With the salmon run in full effect you can expect to see some bears on the river so make sure you have some bear spray handy at all times while on the river or in the bush.  You can purchase bear spray at Spud Valley Sporting Goods ltd. at 1380 birch street in Pemberton, BC. Fly fishing day trips from Vancouver, BC. The Birkenhead river is a short 2 hour drive from Vancouver, BC.  This makes it a very attractive Fly fishing day trip from Vancouver.  It is not uncommon to have the entire river to yourself, not your typical day on the Vedder River or Squamish River.  There are lots of wildlife that include; Bald Eagles, Black Bears, Salmon and Deer that can be observed throughout a typical day on the Birkenhead river.  This gives you the feeling that you are in a very remote part of Canada, with the exception that Whistler is only 35 minutes down the road.  After a great day of fishing, put your feet up and enjoy a warm meal at one of the 50+ restaurants that Whistler and Pemberton have to offer before the trek home along the Sea to Sky highway.  This is truly a recipe for a great day! Birkenhead River fishing guides. I assure you that no one knows the Birkenhead River better than the guides at the Pemberton Fish Finder.  There is something to be said about local fishing guides, that fish a river daily and they know where the fish are.  There is no better way to familiarize yourself with a river than hiring a fishing guide.  We will have you on the fast track to success while sharing fishing holes, helpful tips and local knowledge.  Visit our website for rates and more information about fly fishing in Pemberton and Whistler, BC.  If you would like more information about our fishing company drop us an email at info@pembertonfishfinder.com or call toll free (877)905-8121 to book a fly fishing tour on the Birkenhead River today.

Algonquin Spring Trout Fishing   Day 4   Ralph Bice Lake to Magnetawan Lake You can find the written trip report along with a lot more pictures at: http://www.loonislandoutdoors.com/TripReports/RalphBice/RalphBiceLake.php  We woke up on the final day of our spring fishing trip to find a small trace of snow on the ground. If only we had known what was in store for us the rest of the day. This was one of the few days that I haven't fished on our spring canoe trip. The wind was just too much to make it worthwhile even trying to fish.   This was also the day that my Canon SX30IS camera died from the combination of being too wet and too cold. That camera took a lot of abuse from me, but it's a lesson learned to take a bit better care of it in the future. (yes I had it repaired). I was able to finish recording the trip with my older SX10IS but the last few segments of video aren't HD as a result.   I have to give the kids full credit again for handling the trip out with a lot of skill, zero complaints and even some big smiles.

Trump’s Interior Pick Compares Oil Drilling To Hunting And Fishing Donald Trump nominated Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) to become interior secretary and at his senate confirmation hearing he compared oil drilling to hunting and fishing.  “There are some areas that need to be set aside that are absolutely appropriate for man to be an observer, and I think there are special places in our country that deserve that recognition,” he said. “But a lot of it is traditional uses of what we find in North Dakota and Montana, where you can hunt, you can fish, you can drill an oil well.”   source  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zinke-hearing_us_587eb0e2e4b0cf0ae880b48c?nzhgmem1ji8qhkhuxr ['Ryan Zinke', 'Donald Trump']

Fishing Port Huron Michigan One of the most overlooked industries in the Port Huron area is the Sportfishing Industry.  From shore, it's a very relaxing activity for all ages.  Many boat fishermen are taking clinics from the pro's at Anderson Pro Bait and are increasing their catches, AND therefore, we are seeing more boat fishermen.  The invasive gobies had a secondary effect locally. The bass are pulling up a chair to the dinner table and are THRIVING!  I predict that more tournament fishermen are going to be loitering in these waters to win their tournaments with BIGGER well fed fish!

Cod Fishing, Pines Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador There is no better way to reconnect with (or discover) your Newfoundland and Labrador heritage than by spending a day on the salt water. We did this with Ronan and Cormac by taking them out fishing for cod during the recreational cod season. This was their first time on salt water and we lucked out with a perfectly calm day. The Lads were more than excited when they caught their first codfish and became "official Newfoundlanders" J We put the boat ashore on Green Island and found two gull chicks. While on the island we also watched dolphins just off the shore. This should be a day that they will remember forever.

Fly fishing Birkenhead River in Pemberton British Columbia Fly fishing Birkenhead River in Pemberton British Columbia.  The Birkenhead River holds some of the best fly fishing in British Columbia, Canada and the World.  During the month of May the River has a heavy influence of spring run off.  The spring run off is caused by the melting snow in the mountains.  This keeps the water very cold, well oxygenated and it also washes a ton of feed into the water.  Feed in the form of black ants, stonefly nymphs and case caddis.  During the month of May expect to catch Rainbow Trout, Coastal Cutthroat Trout, Whitefish and Bull Trout.  Although the main stem of the Birkenhead River is very high and swift, it will hold fish.  What we have found to be a much safer alternative to fishing the main stem is fishing the side channels.  The side channels branch off into much smaller, less swift, wadeable sections that carry a ton of structure.  Structure that hosts great hiding for Salmon fry and a wide variety of aquatic Nymphs.  The Month of May also triggers great dry fly fishing.  The days become much longer and warmer.  We have found that as soon as the sun sets behind the mountains in the evenings, the Birkenhead River comes to life with many hatches.  Hatches that include sedges, black gnats, caddis and of course the Mayfly.  The Birkenhead River is located 15 minutes North of Pemberton on Portage road.  Follow the signs North toward the village of D'arcy once you leave Pemberton.  The River is well marked on the Bridge that crosses it.  Once you cross the bridge the Birkenhead River is on your left, pretty well anywhere you see a pull out there is a trail that will take you down to the River.  We always recommend that you carry bear spray while fishing the Birkenhead River because it is common to run into bears throughout the day.  Although there has never been a recorded Bear attack on the River, bear spray is an inexpensive piece of mind.  Bear spray and all of your fly fishing needs are available at Spud Valley Sporting Goods Ltd. in Pemberton, BC at 1380 Birch Street.  Spud is well stocked with all of your fishing needs, they have a great map on the counter and their staff can help you pick out some flies for fly fishing that are working. If you would like to get on the fast track to catching fish on the Birkenhead River the Pemberton Fish Finder offers 3 fishing tours varying length.  A 3 hour introductory fly fishing tour, a 5 hour "half day" and an 8 hour "full day" fishing tour.  Our full day tour includes a tasty shore lunch.  Visit our website for more information about our fly fishing tours, rates and information about our professional fishing guides. We look forward to fishing with you, Pemberton Fish Finder  https://pembertonfishfinder.com/ Below we have included a short fly fishing video and some pictures of Trout from the Birkenhead River.

Browns River Trout Fishing Near Westford Some great Brown Trout fishing just under the bridge in the town of Westford, Vermont.  I was using worms and spinners and castmaster lures and caught some 8-12 inch Brown trout on all those options.  The trout fishing was best with the worms, but they were bitting all sorts of things.  The Vermont department of fish and game officials told me it was recently stocked with trout. ['Brown River', 'trout', 'brown trout', 'worms', 'westford', 'Vermont']

Float Fishing For Trout | Winter Browns Both of us finally get out fishing together at burt dam / eighteenmile creek in search of some brown trout and steelhead. We only fish for 2 hours but managed to catch 3 fish on four hookups. The week before this video Jeff came here and caught 7 browns, the last one being his personal best.   Also, for those who may be wondering, our upload rate has decreased by a lot due to both of us not having enough free time together and due to lost of one of our main camera. However as we get closer to spring we will be uploading back to our normal pace. It is then we will start to have videos of catfish, carp, bass and other fish. But other than that we hope you enjoy!

Ice Fishing On Lake Erie! Or Not! http://www.mikehurl.com - Ice Fishing On Lake Erie. This was our second fishing trip of the year without much luck at all! No one in the entire bay reported catching anything. The only thing we did see were mud puppies on the bottom and some actually surfaced through the wholes in the ice.So if your looking for Ice Fishing On Lake Erie. Grangers ICe Fishing out of St Williams Ontario is a good outfitter.  So from what the guide told me is the best Ice Fishing On Lake Erie is the first few weeks the ice is in or the last week before the huts come off.

Gopro Father's Day Fishing Weekend @ Fountain Lake Thanks for watching!  Location: Fountain lake, Lillooet BC  Date: Father's day weekend 2012  Time spent: 93 hrs  The story: Saw the Gopro commercial. It was so amazing that I just had to get it. I wondered if it was possible to replicate that commercial and applied to the fishing trip. This is the end result. Too bad I only had one Gopro. Imagine if I had three!

Rapala Cruzer M2 Portable Ice Fishing Shelter Assembly - Quinte Ice Fishing Team The Quinte Ice Fishing Team is excited to be running a fleet of the new Rapala Cruzer portable ice fishing shelters this winter.  With our "run and gun" style of fishing, these new shelters are the perfect fit.  Here is a video of us assembling one of the Rapala Cruzer M2, two person shelters.  A mobile approach to hardwater angling can greatly increase your winter success.  While fishing from shore or boat, anglers rarely cast to or sit in a static position for very long, so why do we do this come winter?  Keep moving, cover water and stay on fish! This season Rapala introduces the RapShack Cruzer series of premium ice shelters.  Aptly named, these two flip-over style models provide the utmost in mobility, comfort and functionality.  A shelter that is easily set up by one person and ready to fish in sixty seconds while being protected from all weather conditions is fundamental to a serious ice angler's approach.  Both available options, including a one-person and two-person model were designed with a combined focus on quality and durability in construction, while keeping weight at a minimum.  The sideways sled orientation provides increased fishable area along with enough headroom for unrestricted hook sets.  The tent consists of a quality, double stitched 300 Denier fabric with reinforced corners and reflective trim for night safety and a large skirt for wind resistance.  Three removable windows via Velcro fasteners offer light and the ability to keep an eye outside, yet can be covered to darken the inside when sight fishing.  It also features a mesh storage pocket, an extra-large door with YKK zippers, and a safety ventilation system to prevent moisture build-up and CO2 exposure. The sled design is light & compact and features an oversized padded seat.  For those nicer days when a wind-block is all that you need, a special lock mechanism can be used to hold the tent in an up-right position. The one-man model also features a storage shelf.  Complete this versatile ice fishing platform with additional accessories: The RapShack Cruzer Slider Kit which aids in tracking straighter and pulls easier due to reduced friction. The RapShack Cruzer Travel Cover and RapShack Tow Bar/Hitch are essential components for anglers towing behind an ATV or snowmobile. Beyond mobility, this style of shelter provides a method to store and transport your gear to your favourite ice fishing destination. Stay mobile, and catch more fish with the Rapala RapShack Cruzer series of shelters and accessories this winter.

Spey Casting for Atlantic Salmon & Brook Trout: Miramichi, New Brunswick Atlantic Salmon Fly and Spey Fishing on the Miramichi River System is all what this type of fishing is written about and much more. Heading off to many of the rivers flowing into the Miramichi is quite an experience with Upper Oxbow Adventures in New Brunswick. With the well-seasoned guides from the lodge, you can walk to three of the lodge pools right from your door, or travel off by a traditional ply-boat and prop, a poled canoe or the newly added jet boats. However, you will venture off to the best salmon spey and fly fishing areas accessible in the region. Fishing more than six rivers, you will have the best opportunity at the majestic Atlantic Salmon. You can join the countless others who have made the Upper Oxbow Adventures their choice for the Atlantic Salmon, Striper and Trout Destination of the Miramichi, I did.

PARADOX LAKE 2015 - The one that got away... ...and the one that didn't. Here's a short video of me fishing from my kayak up at Paradox Lake in the Adirondacks. I hooked a couple bass within minutes of each other. One got away, and one didn't. The large bass (I estimate around 13 inches and a couple pounds) was my first catch on my new baitcaster, and my largest bass in my kayak. I caught it on a KVD Strike King 4" Baby Bass Swim'n Caffeine Shad on a VMC 3/16 Standup Shaky Head Jig. No I wasn't talking to myself LOL. Glenn K. was kayaking nearby and he and his son were keeping me company when I hooked the two bass. This video was shot with my GoPro Hero 4 Black (over the shoulder) and my GoPro Hero 3 White (frontal). THANKS for watching!!!

A Ride Up The Kazan River It may not seem like much, but the Kazan River is beautiful. The rapids and fast moving water is an amazing site - especially to see this in person. The fishing for arctic grayling is the best in the world. Trophy arctic graying are the norm here. A trophy garctic grayling is 2.0 lbs. We consistantly caught them at 2.25, 2.5 2.75 and my biggest was a 3.75lb monster. A typical arctic grayling in the United State will be a pound or just a bit more.

Bosko  Ain't Nature Grand! 1931  Leon Schlesinger Bosko goes fishing next to a No Fishing sign. He feels sorry for the worm he's brought; instead he uses the letters on the sign to act as worms. He catches a fish, declares it cute and pets it. The fish spits at him and jumps back into the water. Meanwhile, the worm is not safe yet. A bird chases him; but he escapes into a hole. We're back to Bosko who finds two ladybugs dancing on stones next to a waterfall as a spider plays his web as a harp. A pelican rises up from the water to deposit four frogs next to Bosko. Bosko and the frogs sing and dance. The two ladybugs are mischievous; they use a wasp as an airplane, a flower as a propeller, and a beehive and tree branch as a machine gun. They shoot Bosko with bees, driving him away and into a water fountain. But the happy Bosko tips his hat to the audience to show he's all right.

Halibut Longlining In 1989 the Ask boys went fishing together for a halibut opening. I (Einar) had an old spring wound 8mm silent film movie camera. I shot what I could, and now I realize that this is the only time any of us spent time documenting what we did together for many years.

Algonquin Canoe Trip - Day 4 - McManus Lake to Home You can find the full trip report at: http://www.loonislandoutdoors.com/TripReports/LowerPetawawa/McManusLake.php  Our 4th day was a pretty short one, at least the part on the water was. The drive home was a good 7 hours but don't worry, I didn't put that in the video. We only had to paddle back down McManus Lake so after a breakfast of fruit dumpling and few more "last casts" we were back at the take out and figuring out who won that fishing bet shortly after noon.

The bullhead is a fish to be admired, not only for its tender tasty flesh, but also for its industrious nest-building and the devotion of both parents to their young.
