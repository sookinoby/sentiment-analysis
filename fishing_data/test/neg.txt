Sourdough Raft Race / River Festival - YEGventures Transcript for the Deaf, hard of hearing, and other special needs:  I went to see the Sourdough River Festival for the first time this year. With our parkland and stunning river valley, I don't know why I've never taken a look at the festival here in river city. When I showed up to the launch site a day early on my own mistake, I had the pleasure of speaking with one of the organizers.  Hi, my name is Kira Dlusskaya and I'm the event organizer this year for Sourdough Raft Race Association's River Festival.   We will have a canoe race, we hae a two person raft race that anyone is welcome to enter as well, and then we've got a big raft race as well. So the rafts there are pretty large; they can hold up to 12 people or so. And they usually put a lot of effort into decorating them and it's always a really good fun time. It's a water fight as well so all the rafts are equipped with water guns, pumps, and things like that. It gets really fun especially on a hot day like this.  Among those large entries was Thrft Raft, a raft made completely from crowdsourcing. The raft is built by Alex Lakusta and he explains the story behind the media headliner this year.   We were talking about doing a raft last year and we got married last year and bought a house. We didn't have any have any money to do it, and we didn't have any time to do it. So this year when they postponed it a month, I went on Kijiji looking for barrels 'cause I figured that's the best place to get them. And I saw that there was a bunch of plywood in place and... everything. So I just figured, what the hell, why not just do it all for free.  How much do you think all of this material would normally cost?  It's a few hundred bucks I'm sure.   It's probably 80 bucks worth of straps.   And whatever you can get the barrels for. We have a $170 pump in my garage that doesn't work.   How many hours?  20-25?  That's it?  It didn't take very long once we got going; once you build the deck.   I notice you have a Make Something Edmonton logo on it.    Yeah. One of the guys behind Make Something Edmonton - Chris LaBossiere, he was nice enough to give the entry fee if we put the logo on.   Actually the other parts of this front used to have his name on it.   The #ThriftRaft was so popular that it had its own Twitter hashtag and ended up winning the Titanic award and best 1st entry this year.   Back to the event, Kiera tells us about the River Fest.   The event started in 1960 with the first crew going down from Edmonton Power and they thought, "What's a fun thing to do in Edmonton?" So they decided to start off in Devon back then. They built rafts from logs on site and they had a big party. They entry fee was a bottle of whiskey. That was back then and it's changed a lot.   The name sourdough has very little to do with the bread. It's called sourdough because the prospectors used to come out to this general area during the Klondike times and they would always have a little bit of sourdough with them. So then people would call THEM sourdoughs. And they had rafts going up and down the river, so I think that's where they got the inspiration from.  For the large raft race, it's not a timed race per se; it's more judged based on the construction of the raft, and team spirit, and how much fun you have out there. It usually gets down to Rafters Landing at around 3 to 3:30. We do however, give out the Titanic award to whoever crashes first cause we do have something like that once in a while. We do have safety personnel on staff on the river, and everybody's safe even at that time.  While the River Fest in mid-August this year due to the Alberta floods, next year's 55th annual River Fest will return to its usual slot during the K Days.   It was a raft... it looked good on paper.   If you like what you see, don't forget to like and subscribe for more content!

The Treasure That Changes Humanity A treasure known as the oak island money pit which could contain the holy grail or ark of the convenant, relics of the bible, continues to mystify and challenge even the most experienced treasure hunters.  In the late 1700's, early settlers of New Scotland, now known as Nova Scotia, discovered what appeared to be the site of a pirate's deeply buried treasure.  No one has ever been able to reach the bottom, and the unknown treasures remain waiting to be discovered, despite ongoing diligent attempts, even today.  Professional excavators and treasure hunters managed to reopen the original stone cut shaft to an incredible depth of over eighty feet deep, when they discovered a huge stone block with strange symbols carved into it's surface, that appeared to be a secret code.  A Halifax schoolmaster broke the code and translated the message into English, “forty feet below, two million pounds lie buried”.  But as soon as they dug any deeper, the pit flooded with water and collapsed in on itself, as if booby trapped.   These were clearly no common pirates.  Over the years, other excavated pits, and strange Masonic symbols and imagery on the island have revealed themselves, seemingly hidden in plain sight.  Eventually an expert codebreaker would realize that the clue stone was actually inscribed with an extremely clever dual code.  Using a centuries old decoder ring, the clue stone's code could actually to be translated into Spanish as well, with a very different message. “At 80, pour corn in the long inlet drain.  Signed, F.”.    It's theorized that corn dumped into a nearby pit would clog the inlet drain and render the flooding booby trap harmless.   And that this may be the signature of Sir Francis Bacon, a founding father of the Freemason's, spiritual descendant's of the Knight's Templar, legendary for their riches and rumored to possess, and have hidden, the Holy Grail.

Fort Albany and Kashechewan Ice Road Adventure.m4v Travelling from the Cree communities of Kashechewan to Fort Albany in James Bay, over the ice roads. Main ice roads were still not open, so we took the "ice trails" beside the ice roads - much rougher. We hit water on the ice in some spots which was terrifying, but our driver, Chris Duchesne (Air Chris) got us back and forth several times without a problem. The sunrise over James Bay is beautiful and the people we met wonderul. Enjoy!

Abandoned Castle: Dundas, Beaverkill, Roscoe NY, insane history, 33 degree The castle also known as the “Craig-E-Clair Castle is a name that came from a small town by the name of Craig-E-Clare in Scotland.  The home was built between 1915 and 1924 and was supposedly modeled after a 15th century’s castle in Scotland, located near Edinburgh. Originally,  this Dundas castles plot of land had summer a lodge and back in the days many lodges were masonic  which are frequently visited by the  Free Masons who would  perform masonic rituals.  This secret society has been known on certain days of the year like Halloween or walpurgissnacht  to hold satanic luciferin rituals from their  Luciferin colanders. This  castles story gets crazier. In 1915, the New York architect Bradford Lee Gilbert was employed by Ralph Wurts-Dundas to build his castle.   The famous architect was a driving force in the growing railroad industry and was also associated with the secret society that had names like James Hill, Jay and George Gould, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Edward Harriman, Collis P. Huntington, Rockefeller, Morgan and few more Illuminati members.  Bradford Lee Gilberts the architect was famous for building the  Tower Building which was  New York City's first skyscraper in 1888. This 12 story skyscraper was mysteriously torn down in 1914 because of mysterious financial reasons. While building the castle,  R. W. Dundas’ wife and child would visit the castle construction site frequently to observe its construction..  The castle was never finish and the Dundas family never moved in because in 1921 R.W. Dundas died or may have even been   murdered? We will never know.  What was interesting, was right  after his death  several doctors who had some interest in the Dundas fortune  committed his late wife Muriel Harmer Wurts-Dundas to a mental intuition which at that time had no national standards for psychiatric care. Back in those days they basically restrained patients for days and weeks at time. Many cases of rape, sexual molestation, rage beatings are not uncommon and still go on today. Even today,   psychiatrist  and phycologists are the number one sex abusers, and woman and child  rappers in this country.  These doctors have made up profession that virtually has no scientific justification,  rape children, rape women who are drugged  or restrained and then go home and have dinner with their families like nothing every happed. Later in the 1950’s psychiatric institutions experienced with LSD, electro shock, sleep deprivation, CIA mind control and even conducted over 80,000 known lobotomies one of which was done to John F Kennedy’s sister Rosemary Kennedy because she was slightly promiscuous and   her father Joseph P. Kennedy was afraid she would might blemish the Kennedy name.  While the late Dundas was living the rest of her life institutionalized, her only daughter Muriel was being raised by nannies and care takers in which time the 40 million dollar Dundas fortune was slow depleted. It makes you wonder, a dead millionaire, a committed wife from a potential fake diagnosis of mental illness and a  child that had a 40 million dollar fortune which had the  magical power of diapering. After the only child Muriel being   basically robbed  blind, her mental stability was also questioned, most probable  to shut her up and  she too was committed and placed in a  sanatorium in England On May 2nd, 1949 . After this long chain of events, the caste was purchased by the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of the Masonic Order for $47,5000  and the masonic rituals most probably  continued. Today the castle continued to sit empty at the top a mountain in Roscoe New York.

#08. Hazards and Obstacles RiverWatch staff and participants can encounter three serious rafting hazards - sweepers, strainers and bridge pillars.  Sweepers are trees and branches that overhang the water and have the potential to "sweep" people out of a passing raft.  Strainers are logs or trees that have become partially or fully submerged and have the potential to "strain" people and rafts out of the passing water.  If a raft impacts a bridge pillar, its best if the raft deflects off at an angle.  If a raft broadsides a bridge pillar squarely amidships, the "highside" call requires paddlers to quickly shift to the downstream highside of the boat to help weight it down and prevent the raft from "riding up" the pillar.  In all cases, hazards and obstacles are best avoided by choosing the best route of passage far in advance. ['Part']

My survival Kit (Part 1) INFO PLEASE READ:      Some of the items - I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE, AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  THIS IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY - If you do so and you injure someone playing doctor, you're on your own.  Always seek proper Medical attention.    This is my survival kit.  I'm not a minimalist, or a purest.  Some will carry very tiny packs or those kits in hollow handle knives, and that's great.   I find a survival kit can be personal, because of what kind of outdoor activities you do, or where you live.  Mine isn't a perfect kit, but I'm happy with it.     My kit is heavy on 1st Aid, and fire starting, and less on food gathering based on possible survival times going without (depending on conditions):    1 -1st aid,  (can be minutes)  2 - Protection from elements/warmth,  (minutes to hours)  3 - safe drinking water,  (Hours to days)  4 - food I consider the least important. (UP TO A MONTH - Doesn't mean I want to go without it, just means you can die faster without the first three.)    Some of the items not well discussed (See above disclaimer):    Oral Tetracycline:  I've used it, and I feel confident in my knowledge.  Good for low-grade bact. infections of digestive tracts from drinking untreated/non-filtered water.    Iodine:  I don't use it for injuries as It tends to sting and it's harsh on tissue trying to heal.  I use it for emergency water treatment.  1-2 drops per quart, shake to mix, and let stand for 20-30 minutes.  Tastes like crap, but better then not having drinkable water.      Betadine Surgical Scrub  (http://www.shopinprivate.com/besusc.html)    I find this is much better for cleaning wounds, your hands prior to 1st aid, etc.   It's non-stinging and very gentle.  Not as harsh as Iodine.  Used in Hospitals for surgery.    Hemostats:  I'm happy to say I've never had to use them to clamp a blood vessel (or more serious like that), but I have done sutures.  The smaller ones work great as clamping tweezers.  Hemostats are also great for sewing repairs thru tough material.

Juneau Alaska Travel Guide From the Alaska Experience Travel Guide to Alaska;   Cruising Alaska on an Alaskan Cruise for a stop in Juneau  ( http://www.videosource.com for stock footage.)  Complete Travel Guide program rentals available soon    "In the early 1900's, the swell of gold rush activity   moved alaska's political and economic focus north to   the town of juneau.   Juneau   is a busy modern city thrust up against a   15,000 square mile ice  capped  range of mountains   with water on the other side.    In alaska nature dwarfs   Human achievement and yet up against these elemental   forces,  the people   persist and even thrive.  Not only   Do they thrive -- they have fun!  Juneau still has the rollicking energy of those two   miners joe juneau and richard harris who discovered   Gold here in the 1880s. In the 1940's the mines closed   and government  replaced mining as the chief occupation,   but juneau never lost that frontier sense of optimism   And excitement.  There are, of course, all the modern   buildings that one would expect in a state capitol,   But the real flavor of juneau is that of the old west.   where the sidewalk ends, the undaunted citizens of this   flamboyant town didn't quit. They took their buildings   up the hill.  Its not hard to imagine what those days   And nights were like during the peak of the gold boom,   And still today, the alaska hotel with   its antique   Furnishings   shows what a visitor to this town could  Expect in the way of accommodations back  in the  days   When gold was king and victoria was queen.   but unlike old western towns of the lower forty-eight,  Juneau has a glacier within walking distance!  The famous mendenhall glacier is receding, and as it does  The land hungry people of juneau follow it with buildings.   because of its geographic limitations, the city of juneau has   trouble finding the space it needs.   Ironically, it's   Actually the second largest city in the world! ......  In terms of geographical size,   but one of the smallest in terms of usable space.     it's the capital of the state of alaska but a capital   without room to grow.    in 1974 the people of alaska voted to move the state   Capital to anchorage, but they never voted  in  the funds   For the move.  Today juneau remains the political capital,  But  because of  its location and its room for growth,   anchorage has become the financial capital of alaska " ['Alaska', 'Travel', 'Alaska travel guide', 'Inland Passage', 'Inside Passage', 'Marine Highway', 'Juneau Alaska', 'gold rush', 'alsaka gold rush', 'mendenhall glacier', 'receding glaciers', 'Alaskan hotel', 'cruising Alaska', 'capital of Alaska', 'state of alaska']
