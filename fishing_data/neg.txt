Summer Solstice June 2011 - Canada Rocky Mountain high this ain't, but it's close.  Up in the mountains of British Columbia there are many lakes and lodges catering to campers and fishermen.   Predominantly the fish of choice is the rainbow or Kamloops trout, colorful and good eating, they are relatively easy to catch. Fly fishing, trolling or just fishing with bait like worms can be productive.   This video was filmed at Beaver Lake which is about 20 km from Kelowna.   WARNING!!!

Fishing Boats with a Lot of Space When doing a lot of deep fishing in rough water, it's nice to be able to have all the gear you might need with you but also a bit of space to maneuver around it all. Italo introduces the Seabreeze Boats, which have been modified to give you considerable leg room when out on the water. These boats are great when fishing for salmon or trout in deep water.

While on the northern peninsula of Newfoundland, we heard about a humongous iceberg that could be seen from the shore.  We asked for directions at a nearby campground and two gentlemen who happened to be there, offered to take us out onto the water to see it up close.  We then encountered a humpback whale, and ended it off with a glass of rum on ice... ICEBERG ICE!

Homemade boat loader Here is my home made boat loader system. In this video I show it operating (both loading & unloading)  I created this system because my boat, a Lund WC12, weighs in at 205 pounds.  Much too heavy for me to heave up on a truck rack by myself.  I used an ATV winch welded to some square tube steel into my front receiver hitch.  This allows me go camping with my toys!  I also carry my dirt bike on the front of the truck on a motorcycle carrier.   I created this because the fully automatic boat loaders cost $3000 or more and my system came in just over $500.

The ONE and ONLY Model Ship Bluenose II (2006) on YouTube This is my second Bluenose model (I used the first, a smaller-scale Bluenose I, as a sort of "trial run"), completed in early 2006. The kit, by Bateaux Leclerc, reproduces the original Bluenose II ship (1963), which differs from the contemporary ship we know today. My current project is another Bluenose II model on the same scale, but in the more contemporary version (see my video "At the Helm of Bluenose II in 2006"). I expect to complete it sometime in 2009. Oups... make that 2010!  --------------------------------------------  Après un rodage effectué avec un petit modèle du Bluenose I, j'ai complété ce Bluenose II au début de 2006.

Mon projet actuel, que je compte achever en 2010, est un autre modèle du Bluenose II selon la même échelle, mais qui reproduira le navire dans sa version contemporaine (voir ma vidéo intitulée «At the Helm of Bluenose II in 2006»).

Fish Grilling Tips and Recipe - Marinade and BBQ (Tautog Recipe) Welcome to today's fish cooking episode of Thundermist Fishing Tips. Today we're going to be BBQ'ing some delicious tautogs.  Check out the catching Tautog video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5gexGEOO9o  Antonio, the boatless angler himself, shares with us his recipe. He makes a quick and easy marinade which only needs to rest with the fish for about two hours before cooking.  The big issue when it comes to BBQ'ing fish is that the fillet tends to stick to the grill. The secret to that is to simply leave the skin and scales on. If you descale it, the skin still tends to get stuck to the grill. The best way to prevent your tautog fillet from sticking to the BBQ is to leave the scales on. This applies to other fish as well! There are other methods of course, like tin-foil, or other purchasable ways, but we find that simply leaving the skin and scales on is the simplest method when it comes to barbecuing fish.  For this marinade, it's simple and you don't need to be precise. First you start with a generous amount of olive oil in a plastic bag. Add one full lemon, squeezed, pits and all. We also added some paprika, simple onion powder (just some, you don't want to over do this part), garlic powder (again, just a bit to taste. You can overdo this as well). Mix them all right into the bag along with a bit of black pepper. And that's it!  Next add all the fillets into the bag, the fillets with the skin and scales. Close the bag, and mix them all together. Take out any additional air from the bag, re-seal, and let it rest in the fridge.  The longer you let the fish marinade, the better. But for today we only let the tautog marinade for 2 hours. Overnight in the fridge is a great suggestion as well.  The grill is preheated to 400 degrees F. We want to char the bottom of the fillet along the skin and scales. There's no need to flip the fish, and the whole cooking process usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish with the lid closed.  Don't forget to pour the extra marinade over the fish to get all the flavour.  We did not add salt to the marinade, the best way is to salt the fish while it is on the grill, or even on the table when about to be severed.  You can tell when the fillets are ready as the fillets will start to crack and flake apart. Taking the fish off of the grid should be much easier now with the skin and scales on.  This recipe works not only on Tautog, but on any non-frozen fish as well!

Mountain That Fell On A Town. Oct- 2015 Frank slide. The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of the mining town of Frank, Northwest Territories,[nb 1] Canada, on the morning of April 29, 1903. It occurred at 4:10 am, when over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of limestone rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble.    For those that are thinking this is in Alberta, you are of course correct,  but in 1903 it was still considered The North West Territories until it was changed  and we officially became the Province of Alberta in 1905.

How to Cook Mackerel and Bluefish - Easy with No Fishy Taste We are back in the kitchen again, and do I ever have a recipe for you!  This recipe is for any fish that tastes overly fishy. for example mackerel or bluefish. This recipe takes all the fishiness out of the fish while leaving you with an amazing dish!  It's easy to do, as with all our recipes, and it takes basic ingredients which you most likely already have in your kitchen. Here's what it takes:  Ingredients - 3 TBS olive oil - diced tomatoes - chili pepper - oregano - salt and pepper - 2 onions, thinly sliced - 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced  And that's it!  First you'll want to slice up your two onions and your two cloves of garlic. I like to slice them very thin, as they tend to cook up nicer this way. That's it for the prep!  Next you'll want to take your three tablespoons of olive oil and add it to your pan. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and lightly fry the onions and garlic for about 2-3 minutes. This way the olive oil can absorb the flavour from the onion and garlic.  Next, take your diced tomatoes and pour them into the pan with the already cooking oil, onions, and garlic mixture. This is where you'll want to add your salt, pepper, and oregano. Basically what you're doing is seasoning your tomatoes.  You'll want to use about a teaspoon of salt and as much black pepper and oregano to taste. If you want, you can add chili pepper to the mix. I like to add that bit of heat.  Now with this mix, we're going to stir everything together and let it simmer over medium to medium high, for about 10 to 15 minutes, just enough to make sure everything is all cooked together.  After the 10/15 minutes, you can add any type of fish you'd like. I suggest using a fish that is stronger or fishy tasting like mackerel or bluefish. You'll be amazed how great they taste! Cut your fish fillets into halves and add them to the mix. You can add them whole if you'd like. This works well with whole fillets, half fillets, or even a whole mackerel!  Make sure you mix the fish up with the tomatoes and get everything all simmering together. Cook the fish for about 10 to 15 minutes depending how high you have the heat. You'll want to keep them simmering.  You'll know when the mackerel or bluefish is done, when the fish fillets starts to break apart a bit.  The last step, is to enjoy!

Everything in numerology goes in a 9 year cycle, so we've come cycle given that the last 9 year, 2004.   The Number 9 is about endings.

Sask Yak Fishing - Pelican Catch 120 finally  hits the water Finally after a long wait, it's time to test our new Kayaks With our tight budget we did great! I purchased the Pelican Catch 120 from Canadian Tire, it's 11' 8" long and 34" wide, I'm 6' 2" and a  big guy and this yak has room to spare as well as it sits high on the way and remains extremely stable. LOVE IT!!!!  Venus "Sask Angler" Purchased the Ascend D10T from Bass Pro in Alberta, it's 10' Long & 34" wide, she's mid 5' and has tons of room left, it's extremely stable as well.  Both yaks are perfect fishing vessels, crazy stable, agile and fairly quick for their width.  Verdict: The Catch 120 is the best pelican yak I have ever used, I'm very impressed with it's quality, performance and layout. As for the Ascend D10T, this kayak is also very impressive for quality, performance and space for a 10' yak, it should have been bass pro's first 10' sit on fishing yak. If you're on a tight budget consider either of these 2 yaks, you won't be disappointed. Keep your rod bent and lines tight!!!

Unlucky Duck in Sault, Ontario A poor duck near the marina in St. Mary's River, in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, with a fishing lure caught in its foot. The hook seems to be through the web of the left foot. The duck was dragging that foot a bit, but it didn't seem to trouble it too much in the water. Probably a different story on land, though...

Our lodge borders the Atnarko River and in the fall the Grizzly Bears come down to feast on the spawning Salmon. We are smack in the middle of what is one of the healthiest bear habitats in the world and often the bears can be seen wandering past the lodge. Sometimes we even catch them napping on the lawn.  All accommodation at the Tweedsmuir Park Lodge is in one of ten private chalets with the main lodge providing lots of common space for dining, games, and socializing. It is perfect set up for family reunions and corporate groups, which can book the full premises, yet intimate enough that the individual traveler and smaller groups will feel at home. The focus throughout is on great service, and an authentic, welcoming Canadian hospitality.  Although the lodge and the entire Bella Coola Valley are geographically remote, it is nevertheless easy and convenient to make your way to our door step.  At Tweedsmuir Park Lodge we are lucky to live in a stunning and pristine environment and have a wonderful community supporting us. We are committed to keeping it that way and ask all our guests to participate in our environmental stewardship initiatives to ensure that Bella Coola continues to be the most extraordinary place in the world to enjoy the great outdoors.  Join us. Your expectations will be surpassed!!

Grey wolf swimming to shoreline-  Ontario Canada - We were on a fly in fishing trip to Abamasagi lake ontario when the unexpected happened.  I have read about this from the thickest books and have only seen 1 photo in a friends cabin, it is rarer sight then a Minnesota Vikings winning super bowl trophy, I know that is rare being from Minnesota.    If my father and I had not fished this point the night before the walleye would have been so thick that this would not have been possible.    A swimming grey wolf...  #do not get me too close.  #Awesome Possum, Holy Cow.  Thanks for viewing.

Episode 31 - Float Tube Phoenix on Mike Lake Mike Lake in Golden Ears Provincial Park is a fantastic close to home lake.  Mike Lake is stocked with Fraser Valley Hatchery Rainbow Trout several times a year.  These are your typical triploid clones, easy to catch and not very thrilling to land.  On Mother's Day I pulled my old Belly Boat float tube from storage and put it to work.  It has been over ten years since I fished Mike Lake and it is the lake where I cut my teeth as an angler.

Kayaking in the Great Bear Rainforest in October 3 ATBO students from College of the Rockies, Golden start a kayaking trip in Bella Bella and end in Prince Rupert. This Journey took them 26 days of paddling through the Great Bear Rainforest of British Columbia. Home to the spirit bear, grizzly bear, black bear, wolves, humpback whales, orcas, dolphins, seals, sea otters, river otters, and lots more. It is truly the Amazon of the North. What is so terrible is Canada has a projected plan to ship oil through this waters via 1000 foot oil takers through less than 2 km wide channels. Up in these waters are some of the biggest tides on the Pacific Coast and it would be complete and utterly chaotic. SAY NO TO ENBRIDGE!!!! ENJOY.

The best part; a short walk down the road is a fabulous beach, and miles of sand to explore in either direction in almost complete privacy and seclusion. The lot also sits on a hill which grants the new owner some amazing 360 degree panoramic views of the ocean, beaches, and the surrounding rolling hills. This extra large lot or acreage could be completely customized for your new dream home with a view. All for a very low price. Located near Evangeline Region, Maximeville, Cap-Egmont, Abram Village, Urbainville, Wellington, St. Raphael, Mont Carmel, Richmond, Egmont Bay, Union Corner, Union Corner Provincial Park, and St. Nicholas. Located west of Charlottetown, the Confederation Bridge in Borden, Kensington, and Summerside.

1000 Islands 360_Aerial of Rock Island Lighthouse Sunset Rock Island Lighthouse is located in the Thousand Islands about 4.5 miles northeast of Clayton, Jefferson County, New York, off of Fisher's Landing. Originally commissioned in 1847, it is one of six lights put up along the St. Lawrence River to guide traffic to and from Lake Ontario through the waterway. The Rock Island station is the best preserved, as all of its structures still survive. It was refitted in 1855, rebuilt in 1882, and moved in 1903. The light was closed in 1955 after more a century of service.  In June 2013, the island and all its buildings were  reopened to the public as a park maintained by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation & Historic Preservation.  The island is accessible by private boat and local shuttle service, and the grounds are open for touring and picnicking. www.rockislandlighthouse.org questions? riverjeffry@gmail.com jeffweldon.com ['1000 islands', 'rock island lighthouse', 'lighthouse', 'thousand islands', 'boating', 'tourism', 'vacation', 'boat', 'clayton', 'new york', 'canada', 'river', '360', 'sunset', 'fishing', 'fisherman', 'photooftheday']

Denbigh 1967 Centennial Celebrations by Bill Scott This early 8mm film was discovered in the basement of the Denbigh Community Hall around 2001 during some 'spring cleaning'. It was digitized and used as a fund raiser for the Addington Highlands Public Libraries.  The video was filmed by Mr. Bill Scott (now deceased) - owner of Scott's Shopping Centre at the base of Eagle Hill (Ashby Lake Road).  Bill had the foresight to video record many community activities during the 1967 Centennial year in Denbigh.  The entire film is 31 minutes long and starts with the New Year's Eve Dance followed by the Ski-doo Races on Denbigh Lake displayed above with the dance afterwards.    Other activities in the full version include Track & Field, Parades, Fishing Derby, Winter Carnival, Maple Syrup Festival and Old Home Week.

Temagami Ontario Canada flv   YouTube Temagami is the reality that fuels the popular perception of Canada's great North land, with old growth pine forests; smooth blue waters; brilliantly white, powdery snow; and bountiful fish and wildlife.  Temagami is steeped in history. Some of the world's oldest rock has surfaced here, and has been scraped and smoothed by centuries of glaciation. Artifacts and stone drawings dating as far back 6000 B.C. have been discovered here. Grey Owl, the mysterious naturalist who captured the world's imagination back in the 1930s, has become a part of the Temagami landscape. Over the centuries, people have been drawn to the area as if by a magnet. Temagami is truly a place of mystical magic, an adventurer's mecca.  Temagami has been a renowned centre for outdoor and wilderness recreation for over 100 years.

Nine Lakes, Haliburton County, Ontario, CANADA Located in Haliburton County, just 2 1/2 hours north of Toronto, Nine Lakes is a pristine reserve of just under 7000 acres of forest, lakes and rivers. Divided into nine parcels, each with its own lake, this rugged, unspoiled wilderness awaits your adventurous spirit. First explored by pioneer loggers pushing up from the Ottawa valley in the early 1800’s much of the Haliburton area is now protected and preserved as a wildlife sanctuary.   A mix of coniferous trees, maple forests and spruce bogs, Nine Lakes is alive with white tail deer, black bear, beaver, wolves, moose and dazzling mix of bird species including Indigo Buntings, Boreal Chickadees, Grey Jays and Spruce Grouse. The rivers and lakes teem with Trout, Muskie, Walleye and Northern Pike providing outstanding fishing.  Nine Lakes, whether it’s a corporate retreat in a private piece of Canadian Wilderness at its very best, a quiet long term family investment with that idyllic lakeside home you’re always dreamed of, or as a whole parcel with significant development potential, the Nine Lakes adventure awaits your touch.

Scuba Kahnawake 2011 Scuba movie filmed with my new camera Sony DSC-HX9V with an Ikelite undewater case also a Bonica dive led light G8V15 and a wide angle conversion dome WD-4.  This movie have been filmed at the beautiful Kahnawake quarry near Montreal QC Canada in september 2011. I think that this setup performed amazingly! the only drawback that i found is the battery life compare to my old Canon SD780-IS.     Note : The vigneting in the corners is only due because i did not place the wide angle len sun shield as it sould be, i fixed the problem at the end of the movie as you can see.

Presque Isle State Park - Full Drive Through If you are thinking about taking a trip to Presque Isle State Park, or want to remember what it looks like from a past visit, this is a video of what it looks like to drive around the park.  There is a main loop that first goes along the shore of Presque Isle Bay, turns around near the tip of the peninsula, and then travels along the shore facing Lake Erie.  Although there are several places that were not explored, this is a drive on the main road with two popular side-roads (near the beaches facing Lake Erie).  If you like the video or found it useful, don't forget to give it a thumbs up.

Wood River Expedition Episode 1: Sunwapta Falls to Athabasca Crossing The plan was to accomplish the first descent of the remote Wood River in British Columbia by hiking into 24km from Sunwapta Falls into it's headwaters at Fortress Lake, paddling 15km across the lake, 30 km down the river (excluding 2 major class VI waterfall filled canyons) then ascending back up 3500 ft in 37 km to the continental divide though Athabasca pass, crossing into Alberta again and navigating the Whirlpool River the remaining 80 km back to the Icefield Parkway.   Turns out there is a reason no one has ever done this before. Luke Schmidt punctured his raft, we did some canyon swimming,ended up losing both boats (and my paddle) in a gorge. This necessitated some severe bushwhacking and spending some chilly nights on the mountainside, but in the end we completed this 5 day trip in a mere 11 days :).   In this episode we eat wild strawberries, do some hiking, get wet, try out my new Ultralight Tipi Tent by Seek Outside (the BT-2) and do some fishing in the most beautiful little lake you'll ever see.

Conversations That Matter Episode 18 Jim McIsaac Episode 18 Jim McIsaac BC Commercial Fishing Caucus  This week’s Conversation that Matters features Jim McIsaac of the BC Commercial Fishing Caucus.  McIsaac says, since the restructuring of the commercial fishing industry in the 90’s communities up and down the coast have been disenfranchised from the sector that was their lifeblood. He says, it comes at a time when fish stocks are well managed and robust. McIsaac points out fishing is a fraction of its former size.

ATV Rain Ride! The Grizzly 700 Is Back On Zilla's - Wheelie? - May 18 2013 Cubbeezx is about Cubbee and CK's  everyday real life ATV Moto Vlogging X'LeNt Adventures.  Our regular quad rides are a 2011 Yamaha Grizzly 700 EPS and a 2011 Yamaha Kodiak 450 SE EPS.  On weekends, we usually can be found exploring the back woods of North Western Ontario on wheels or tracks.  First ride of the season without the tracks on the Yamaha Grizzly 700! Unfortunately, it poured rain the whole weekend. We weren't going to let that stop us. Cubbee had not done a wheelie in like 8 or 9 months and was starting to have withdrawals! lol Did the Gilbert Lake loop trail, it was awesome. A herd of black bears ran across the trail in front of us. At first we thought there were three big ones, but I think there may have been four!! On the way home we came across the smallest baby deer we have ever seen. It was trying to cross the highway with it's mom. We waited for it and it turned around and hit in the ditch, so we managed to get a quick picture of it.    If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

Burr Lake ATV Ride Via The Beaver Dam Trail - July 14 2013 Out for a Sunday quad ride on the Yamaha 700 Grizzly and Kodiak 450 atv's to Burr Lake. I think it was about a year or two ago we had gone through this trail. Lots of beaver dams to cross, but nothing too bad. Not sure why, but the water levels in Burr Lake were down about 3 feet.

Geocaching in Nipigon Every Labour Day weekend, a pair of geocachers from Nipigon organize a cache hunt to coincide with the Nipigon Fall Fishing Festival. Geocachers from all over North Western Ontario descend upon the community for caching and fun.  This year, we went again, and I took my two year old son for a hike up to The Bald Spot to find a couple geocaches. I wasn't quite sure what to expect for the trail up there, or the difficulty of the climb. The trail and geocache were very nice, but I was mostly impressed by my son who did the hike all by himself.  It was a beautiful fall morning, the leaves were just starting to change colour, and it smelled wonderful. We had a great hike and geocache hunt, and I wanted to save the memory with this video.

The lighter side of Dogskin Lake Lodge We're pretty serious about our fishing, but when you're on an island for 4 months, you've got to have a little fun.  Here's some quick clips of a few great guests from Illinois and Arizona, as well as our staff from the past couple of days.  FYI, the guitar playing was at 10:30pm...

Music Video #1 (Sweet Potato Fly) The first in a series of videos for my original music, this song seemed like an appropriate starting point.  I used images and video clips from my last family fishing trip to Campbellford, Ontario, including beautiful landscapes and some great footage of my brother Mike catching a nice musky.  Using a slow zoom in/out on the still images made several of them appear as if the water is actually rippling.  My goal was to use simple editing techniques and processes to produce a dreamy atmosphere.

Kurt with input from Chelsea O'Hanley in July 2016, both having no North American Indigenous ancestry, and with some input from Holly Hladuk, who does have some North American Indigenous ancestry. The documentary was further developed and edited by Donna R. Kurt to document existing FRCN Elders and community food systems status.

Automata Fishing Video of an automata project depicting a young boy fishing from a cottage dock on a warm summer day. He has his dog with him who excitedly looks into the water for fish. Two seagulls loiter nearby hoping to get some sort of tidbit. Under the dock lurks a largemouth bass, apparently uninterested in the bait. A catfish rests deep in the shadows and a crayfish moves in and out from his lair in some rocks. Unnoticed by the boy s little fish anxiously jumps at the bait just as the line is lifted and misses.

Carpe Lac Saint-Pierre Saison 2012.wmv Voici quelques moments de pêche de cette saison 2012 au Lac Saint Pierre, Québec, Canada. Une saison inoubliable...  Le lac Saint-Pierre constitue en réalité un élargissement du Saint Laurent. Il se divise en plusieurs bras à Sorel, découpant ainsi les îles du Lac. Ces différents bras se rejoignent alors pour former le lac, puis le fleuve reprend sa morphologie au niveau de Trois-rivières. Classé réserve mondiale de la biosphère, le lac Saint Pierre et ses îles affirment donc leur grande richesse : plus de 70 espèces de poissons, dont 8 sportives : carpe, esturgeon jaune, achigan petite et grande bouche (bass et black bass), dorés jaunes et noirs (sandres), maskinongé & brochet.   La Pourvoirie du Lac Saint Pierre se situe au coeur des îles, lui offrant un incroyable territoire de jeu, capable de ravir n'importe quel pêcheur : que vous soyez un inconditionnel du carnassier et des pêches actives ou bien désireux de piquer quelques belles communes vierges sur des spots sauvages lors de sessions mémorables, cette destination est faite pour vous...Osez l'aventure et affrontez le Saint Laurent!   Autres espèces présentes dans la video :  -achigans petite et grande bouche (bass) -dorés jaunes et noirs -maskinongé (1.30 m, 40 lbs) -brochet -poisson castor   Musique : The Glitch Mob - We can make the world stop ['carpe', 'quebec', 'lac saint pierre', 'pourvoirie', 'gopro', 'fishing', 'carp', 'peche', 'maskinong\xc3\xa9', 'achigan', 'canada']

A Pair of Whale Tales from Vancouver Island Goes Viral http://www.ctvvancouverisland.ca http://www.facebook.com/ctvvi  Port Alberni - A pair of amazing fish tales are making the rounds on the west coast of Vancouver Island after two groups of anglers caught some breathtaking close encounters with whales.  Shirley Antonelli and her husband were fishing near the Broken Group Islands off the coast of Ucluelet on a two day trip on their Double Eagle boat when they got the scare of their life. A gray whale suddenly surfaced inches from the front of their boat, before swimming under the vessel and nearly sending the two anglers into the ocean.   The entire encounter was caught on tape.  Weeks earlier a fishing charter off the coast of Tofino got a first hand view of a humpback whale breaching. A client on board the boat caught the amazing mother nature show on tape and sent the company the footage.

Dip Net Fishing in Cape-Breton Dip net fishing in a small pond off the Bras D'or lake in Cape-Breton Nova-Scotia. All fish were returned to the water alive, NONE were kept or harmed. - We spotted the small puddle full of Smelts from the road up a hill and ran down the hill with a dip net. There were probably 1000+ fish in the puddle and if we had a dip net with smaller holes you could have gotten a full net every swipe.

Cannery Closure, Prince Rupert BC Workers speak out about the closure of Jim Pattison Canadian Fishing Company's Oceanside Cannery in Prince Rupert.  Most are Indigenous. They are asking the Canadian Government to legislate policies to keep fish processing local.  Adjacency - process next to where the catch is; Owner-operator - fisher who owns the license, fishes it (not leased by the processors); Fleet separation - keep the fleet separate or not owned or controlled by the fish buyers.

Motorboat Dem Rapids!+Pearl Jam A few years ago the oldest son and I took a Pearl Jam + Fishing vacation.  We flew to Vancouver and enjoyed the city for a few days, then caught the Vancouver PJ show.  Next morning we flew to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, caught some puddle jumpers, ending-up in  La Ronge, Saskatchewan, 500 miles north of the Canadian border.  At La Ronge, the folks from "Angler Rapids" fishing lodge sent a float plane.  After a half hour flight up the Churchill River we came to Angler Rapids, a rustic yet comfortable lodge in a gorgeous wilderness setting.  September days at Angler Rapids are crisp & clear.  Nights with an autumn moon reflecting off the water and a sky full of stars are impossibly beautiful.  (In other seasons visitors get displays from Aurora Borealis).  But it's the waterway that is truly impressive.  The water here is always churning underneath your boat.  This fast, cold rushing current provides Angler Rapids with some of the best Walleye & Northern Pike fishing we've experienced.  After 3 days of FANTASTIC fishing, cooking our catch outdoors over open wood-fires, we had to make our way back home.  But it was OK, we caught Pearl Jam again, this time in Saskatoon, from the 2nd row, Stone's side of the stage.

Big Lake in Skagit County Big Lake is one of my more favorite lakes to visit, despite the fact that I have not personally had much luck there. But there are some big bass in this lake and a ton of nice habitat. The lake has a very good reputation for crappie, also.     The launch is rough and sandy in spots so bigger boats beware.

Hiking Up To Garibaldi Lake, British Columbia (4K) Hiking Up To Garibaldi Lake, British Columbia. I took this trip in Late August of 2016 after I returned to Vancouver from Atlanta in the summer. Ive always wanted to hike up to Garibaldi Lake since my arrival to Vancouver last year. The amazing photos you see on instagram serve this lake no justice. it is 10X better in person.   However, the hype you get from Instagram isn't too good. I though I was going to be able to drive my car up most of the elevation and do a short hike up to get the views that I wanted. To get to Garibaldi lake, it is a 9-10km Hike, and its Steep!

Crayfish! we catch baby crayfish! The crayfish were not harmed in this video and were released in less than one minute.  I have never seen baby crayfish so it was a complete surprise that when we caught a large one in a cup there were several tiny baby crayfish.  I imagine the trout hang around the rocks and feed on any that are not cautious and go into the open.

King Fish Man  • In The Wild • TV Show Crowdfund Trailer This is an overview video which describes the very unique talents of one Timmy Cudmore who humorously calls himself the "KING FISH MAN"! Timmy hails from the beautiful Prince Edward Island in Canada. He writes and sings songs about one of his greatest passions: TROUT FISHING! Yup, I said fishing.  '"In The Wild" is a TV Show idea inspired by the award-winning professor David Musial from America. It is part of the "NextGen Stars®" series in development which focuses on the "MENTOR' to the "Next Generation of Stars" in any field. Timmy teachers his children and grandchildren how to fish. He teaches us all through zany, musical humor, how fun it can be to fish.  Lot's of source footage has been shot in the past 3 years, including a great deal in the new "Ultra HD" format, so this Crowd Funding venture is designed to enable Professor Musial to employ a team of highly skilled, "directors-to-be", college interns, to assist him in producing a few more shoots & editing shows for potential network or social net distribution.  Timmy has many songs available for sales on iTunes, CD Baby ands more. Please consider supporting this cool mentorship venture by visiting KickStarter.com, and also...

Fraser Valley, BC - Harrison River Canoeing We wanted to share how beautiful it is here in the Fraser Valley.  Our location directly on the Harrison River makes for easy canoe launching, and the water is still running high with snow melt, fed primarily from Harrison Lake and also from the Chehalis River.  Just downstream from us, the blue-green water of the Harrison runs into the mighty, and muddy, Fraser River.    This was shot right at the confluence of the Harrison & Chehalis Rivers. The air, water and mountains here are incredibly clean and beautiful.  If you listen closely, you can hear the birds singing.

Yellowknife NT - Aerial view of Cameron Falls Taken July 18 2015. Watch in HD for better viewing.          Cameron Falls  is located within Hidden Lake Territorial Park, on the Ingraham Trail. It is approximately 47 km east of Yellowknife.       There is a small parking lot with pit toilet facilities, at the start of a 20 minute hike along a well marked trail to Cameron Falls. The falls are worth a visit at all times of the year. In winter the falls are frozen right over. In spring, melt-waters roar under the ice. Water levels in summer have been known to drop low enough to allow walking across the falls above the overhang. And in the fall the changing colours of the leaves are always a good reason to bring along your camera.  ATTRACTIONS & POINTS OF INTEREST:      It is possible to hike upstream from Cameron Falls to the Cameron River Ramparts Waterfalls, a distance of 8 or 9 km. The trail is not well developed, but the river is relatively easy to follow and the route is obvious. If you choose to follow the north (far) side of the river, there is a foot bridge at Cameron Falls, which also offers access into the rest of Hidden Lake Park. You will have to re-cross the river at the Ingraham Trail bridge at Cameron River Crossing, a short ways upstream from the Ramparts.       The park offers access for canoeists to the Lower Cameron River Canoe Route, one of the Ingraham Trail Canoe Routes.- www.NWTParks.ca  Tags: Aerial Photography Northwest Territories Canada Drone UAV Waterfalls Canada Yellowknife DJI Phantom 3 2 1 GoPro Camera awesome spectacular scenic view mountains landscape ['Yellowknife (City/Town/Village)', 'cameron', 'falls', 'waterfalls', 'rivers', 'lakes', 'canada', 'edmonton', 'travel', 'nature', 'water', 'fishing', 'dji', 'phantom', 'aerial', 'videos', 'photography', 'montreal', 'quebec', 'cbc', 'tourist', 'Park', 'Adventure', 'Tourism (Interest)', 'Tourist Destination', 'River', 'Waterfall (Geographical Feature Category)', 'National Park (IUCN Category)', 'Ontario', 'Toronto', 'Vancouver', 'Mountain', 'Climbing', 'Trail', 'Mountains', 'Hiking', 'Lake', 'Canyon', 'viral', 'video', 'Aerial Photography (Website Category)', 'Ridge', 'amazing', 'beautiful', 'scenic', 'spectaculaer']

Blane Chocklett's T-Bone Musky Fly Blane Chocklett swings by SO World Headquarters and cooks up his T-Bone musky fly.

More importantly, Blane demonstrates the use of articulated shanks and flex tubing, both of which are really pushing the boundaries of what's possible in fly design. Great stuff Blane!

Why does Alberta allow this illegal practice to continue? As we paddled across the province of Alberta on the North Saskatchewan river we were appalled to see so many cows pooping on shore.  This is an illegal practice and yet despite the fact that these farmers have beautiful large homes, great big shiny farm equipment they are allowed to cut corners and pollute our waters.  All this water flows downstream.  The fish population is stressed and the water is so polluted it's disgusting.  Our actions affect others - how these farmers can sleep at night I don't know.  I think it's a shame that some people care more about money than the environment.  I think it's ridiculous that the Albertan authorities allow this continue.  What do you think? We are all stewards of this land - we must all do our part.

Capilano River Coho Salmon Indian Reserve Massacre North Vancouver British Columbia Capilano Coho Salmon Indian Reserve Massacre in North Vancouver British Columbia September 2012. Not saying anything "illegal" was done here. But sometimes you should not do stuff "just because you can, legally speaking". Oh and read this on Wiki about the Indian Band "The Capilano Reserve is the site of major commercial and residential developments, mostly on the West Vancouver side of its area. These include the Park Royal Shopping Centre and associated apartment buildings, and a small office tower adjacent to the intersection of Taylor Way, and a large recreational vehicle park more or less beneath the northern end of the Lions Gate Bridge (the highway interchange for the bridge is also on reserve land). Foreshore properties along Vancouver Harbour leased from reserve lands include bulk terminals and other port facilities. Revenues from all these arrangements are part of band finances." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%CC%B1wemelch'stn You may want to download this video in case it gets removed again.

⇢ MYSTERY UNBOXING!!! ⇠ March 4th, 2017 - Vaughan, Ontario  Woah!!! This isn't a vlog, nor is it a how-to video. Here's us unboxing something we ordered for a while and was so eager to receive it. We checked the mail as quickly as possible everyday, and Wednesday,  March 1st, 2017 at 5pm we received it.  Had to wait until we got together so we could record an unboxing video for you guys. This is our first impressions - We have not seen it at all. Only idea we had about it was the layout on the computer which looks SO different than in RL (RL=Real Life... For those who had no idea but didn't want to ask "stupid" questions).  We tried to keep it short, sweet, and entertaining by adding a dash of fun. See, not all unboxings are boring.   Don't forget to check out Skollgear (https://skollgear.com) for all sun-protective apparel. They strive to provide you with amazing clothing that'll protect you from the sun while you're out, and to keep you out longer to catch more. ▸ When ordering, let Skoll know we sent you & get a great deal!!  Also, to catch more fish you have to have contact one way or another. Whether it be head-on, the bottom, where ever. Woo! Tungsten gives amazing high quality weights for those flipping and drop shots. More sensitive, to have you feel everything. It's not fishing without any sort of contact. So never forget that "FISHING IS A CONTACT SPORT" and go catch some fish especially equipped with WOO!TUNGSTEN! [ DISCOUNT CODES ] ▸ ▸   Hope you liked it.

Washington Park, Anacortes, WA, USA Beautiful views of Guemes Channel and Burrows Bay as seen from Washington Park and also the park's famous leaning tree (one of Washington state's most photographed tree) in the historic town of Anacortes on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County, Washington, USA during our trip on Sep. 3, 2011.  Washington Park is located on a peninsula at the western tip of Fidalgo Island. The 220-acre city park features camping, a boat launch, and day use picnic sites. The park juts into Rosario Strait on the western edge of Anacortes, offering territorial views. A scenic 2.3-mile one-way loop road winds through the park's forested hills and meadows with views of the San Juan Islands and Olympic Mountains. The park offers sweeping views of Guemes Channel on one side and Burrows Bay on the other.  At Sunset Beach, on the north shore, there is a boat launch, restrooms, reservable picnic shelter, playground and open play area. There are 75 campsites, restrooms, showers and laundry services in the overnight area. Picnic sites and car pullouts provide beach access along Green Point, the west shoreline. The loop road is used by cars, joggers, bicyclists and walkers.  Anacortes is the gateway to the San Juan and Vancouver Islands. Downtown Anacortes has over 125 life-sized murals painted by local resident Bill Mitchell. He painted the murals over the last 25 years from historical photographs. His art is on display all over Downtown buildings with depictions of historic scenes. Pick up a free mural map at the Visitor Center located at 819 Commercial Avenue as it is a wonderful way to discover Anacortes.   Anacortes is located 18 miles west of Mount Vernon and about one hour drive from Bellingham to the north and Seattle to the south.  Driving directions to the park: From I-5 take Highway 20 West. Enter Anacortes on Spur 20 and take Commercial Avenue to 12th Street. Turn left on 12th and follow the signs (about 3 miles) to Washington Park.  Address: 6300 Sunset Avenue Anacortes, WA 98221 USA  For campsite and boat launch parking availability information call: +1-360-293-1927.

The exterior of the house features Cape Cod siding and imported Pennsylvania field stone from Valley Forge Mountain. The stone walls as well as all of the patios are capped in Pennsylvania flag stone, giving the house a natural feel that blends into the surrounding landscape.

Return to Buckhorn - 1971 This Super 8mm movie was shot in July 1971 at Buckhorn Narrows Campground, in Buckhorn, Ontario.  The location is in the Kawartha Lakes region of Southern Ontario.  Included in this are pictures of Buckhorn Lake, the Gannons Narrows Bridge, the Peterborough Lift Lock, and the tour of the Trent-Severn Canal from a tour boat in Downtown Peterborough, which shows the waterspray near Beavermead the CHEX-TV tower and studio facility; and Trent University where the tour boat turns around, to head back to go through the lift lock, then back to the mooring area downtown in Peterborough.    Also included are film segments of my father and his friend fishing for walleye at Buckhorn Lake, plus a site survey we did of what was to had been future places to go and rent a cabin, boat, etc.  Unfortunately, my father (the white haired gentleman) died in 1976 and we never did go as a family to that part of Ontario after 1972.      This movie was shot on Super 8 film and thus has NO AUDIO on it.  It is a historical record of my family and my parents friends from 1971, when we would vacation together.

Best of British Columbia Travel - HelloBC!! Best of British Columbia Travel for me has to be around where I lived so many years ago. The Nicola region has some amazing scenery and we saw none of the garbage and litter that is present in other parts of the province that we just traveled.  The saying is a lake a day as long as you stay and the fishing for rainbow(aka Kamloops) trout can be good.  This is fly-fishing country on small secluded lakes where you might be the only angler.

5 ATV Ride To The Avenger Airplane Crash - May 16 2015 Cubbee leads a group of 5 ATV's to see the old Avenger Airplane crash site, well at least what is left of it.  We were hoping to be able to look for the rock igloo again along the way, but just didn't have enough time.    The wreckage is of an Avenger airplane that crashed near Dryden Ontario in 1971 while fighting forest fires. Fortunately the pilot was ok, but had quite a story to tell.  You can read all about it in an article we found from The Ottawa Citizen at the following link:  http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19710604&id=qccyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ruwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1156,1333027   We did encounter some great, smooth trails though. Nothing too challenging, but some awesome scenery along the way.   The quads with us that day were a 1000 Arctic Cat Mudpro, a 660 and 700 Yamaha Grizzly, a 550 Polaris Sportsman and a Can-Am XT 1000.

Nipissing Ontario Big Cut.mp4 A video I shot while my brother piloted us through whats locally known as Big Cut. As you can see someone had a sense of humour! This was a channel blown out of the rock with explosives to link the Monetville and Noelville water channels in the West Narrows of Lake Nippissing in Ontario, Canada. Our favourite place to fish! We stay at a great place called Lakair Lodge. Kevin and Lesley are wonderful hosts. Check it out if you love fishing and the outdoors!

Grizzly bear encounter at Knight Inlet, B.C. Grizzly bears are the perfect symbol of Canada's untamed wilderness and to see one up close is both awe inspiring and frightening.  Although these majestic animals are found in many parts of Western Canada, one of the best places to observe large numbers of wild grizzlies is in Knight Inlet on the western coast of British Columbia. Every fall, thousands of salmon migrate from the ocean into the Glendale River to spawn and every year large groups of grizzlies gather for a salmon feast like no other.

Rowing on a puddle in the Salish Sea A morning spent rowing on Buntzen Reservoir in Anmore, near Vancouver BC Canada. July 28 2010.   A nice easy row, averaging about 17 strokes a minute. I occasionally row at about 24. But not for too long.  A few more words about this row are on the site http://rowingforpleasure.blogspot.com/2010/08/smuggerooni.html  The boat, "Miracle," is a Whitehall Spirit Solo14, "The Mountain Bike of the Sea," set up for Slide-Seat Rowing using 9.5 ft carbon-fibre oars. It is completely decked, so it has a lot of flotation.  Designed and manufactured in Victoria BC Canada, by Whitehall Rowing and Sail. The boat's hull speed is about 5 knots, or about 9 km/hr. It is quick, as you can see from the video. Not as quick as a racing or ocean shell, but with this hull I can take along my lunch, camera, tripod, water, spare shoes and jacket, extra paddle, shorter oars for rough water, boat-hook, bicycle, tent, an assortment of safety gear, and a passenger or two.

DRONE PHOTOGRAPHY - A Morning With The Ottawa Rowing Club - DJI Phantom Aerial photography filmed with a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced.  The Ottawa Rowing Club is the oldest rowing club in Canada. It was founded on 6 June 1867, the same year as the Canadian Confederation. One of its founders and first patron, Sir John A. Macdonald, was Canada’s first prime minister. In early 1870s, the ORC ceased to exist before being re-introduced on 25 June 1875. The original club house was a wooden building, initially built on pontoons, and moored to the shore of the Ottawa river at the foot of parliament hill, between the Rideau canal and the Chaudière falls. Whilst the view from the club house over the Chaudière falls was picturesque, the rowing conditions were difficult: vast field of sawdust and other refuse from an immense lumber mill situated about the falls, and logs escaping from the booms. Each spring, along with the melting ice, the club house floated downstream and came aground. Every year it was brought back up near the Rideau canal. In 1884 and 1885, the club house suffered important damage when it sank. In spring 1896, the members of the Club decided to purchase a piece of the river front property at 10 Lady Grey Drive and leave the club house in its current, permanent location. An addition (the present boat house) was added to the original building. The club is just west of and below Sir John A. Macdonald's home Earnscliffe that is now the residence of the Britain's High Commissioner to Canada. With close to 1000 members, the Ottawa Rowing Club is one of the largest clubs in Canada.

Georgian Bay Gopro Dinghy Tour - Echo Bay While we were staying at Henry's Restaurant on Georgian Bay, we took our inflatable dinghy our for a couple of hours to cruise over to a popular anchorage at 'Echo Bay'.  The south arm of that bay offers easy access and deep water, right up to shore with excellent protection form winds. The north arm is a little bit trickier to get in to, as there are shallow rocks at the mouth and only the brave ever venture into it.   At the north end of the north arm, there is a narrow and very pretty opening to the big Bay, which you'll see in this video. Always a nice venture into the area, be it Echo Bay, or any one of the dozens of other protected anchorages in the 'designated anchoring bays' of the Massasauga Provincial Park (http://www.ontarioparks.com/park/themassasauga).

Inuit Hunter - Greenland It is said that Greenland means 'the land of man'. To the Greenlandic natives, it is home, where the dark days and sunlit nights demand the human spirit to endure at all costs. Dressed in polar bear pants, seal skin mittens, and a reindeer jacket hand made by his grandmother, Thomas Martika has never left his home town of Qaanaaq, Greenland.   Struggling to hold on to his culture despite changing times, he shares his concerns, "Scientist say there are not many narwhals, or walrus, but form our eyes we can see a lot of animals. We try to say to our government what it's like here but our government does not hear from us, they only follow the word of the scientist. But our quota is too low and we can't hunt very many animals, maybe only enough for 10 or 20 hunters. Many young children must go and look elsewhere for another job." With limited options to make money, many of Greenland's youth have strayed from the traditional Inuit ways.  Greenland is an island of unparalleled beauty, and the coexistence between humans and animals depends upon the delicate balance of nature in the harshest of places.

Fernie BC Bike Park "Riding the trails on Fernie Alpine Resort are like no others we have ridden in any other bike park. It is so much fun to ride lift access trails that are so flowy, buff and loamy. It seems almost unreal that the trails can stay such good condition. I would say it would be easy to enjoy a summer riding in Fernie with such a great variety of trails that keep expanding."

LSSU celebrates 25 years of Atlantic salmon program In the mid-1970s, two friends had an idea for a collaboration that they believed would promote tourism in the Upper Peninsula, strengthen academic offerings at Lake Superior State University and reinforce the already strong community ties of Edison Sault Electric Company, now Cloverland Electric Cooperative.    Their idea, which also included the Michigan Department of Natural Resources as a partner, grew into the LSSU Aquatic Research Laboratory, which has been housed in the Edison/Cloverland powerhouse on the St. Mary's River since its beginning. Prof. Gale Gleason Ph.D., head of the lab and LSSU's Dept. of Biology and Chemistry back then, and William Gregory, former president of Edison Sault Electric, saw the lab grow from a small research facility into a full-blown hatchery operation that this year will mark its 25th anniversary of releasing Atlantic salmon into the river.    To celebrate the occasion, LSSU will name this year's "class" of yearling salmon after Gleason and Gregory. The lab has released between 25,000 and 60,000 Atlantics since its first stocking in 1987. This year, the lab will release more than 30,000 yearlings.

Richard Barch launches ceremonal Class of 2016 Atlantic salmon Much like Lake Superior State University students take a hands-on approach to their education, LSSU staff and guests were able to get their hands wet  while stocking Atlantic salmon on June 3 outside the LSSU Aquatic Research Laboratory in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan’s Alford Park. Lab manager Roger Greil (l) helps Richard Barch and LSSU President Tom Pleger (r) as they prepare to deposit a ceremonial portion of Atlantic salmon yearlings into the St. Mary’s River while dedicating the entire batch of 37,000 salmon as the “Richard Barch Class” during a 30th anniversary ceremony outside the Cloverland Electric Cooperative power plant. Barch, of Ann Arbor, accompanied here by his wife, Theresa, was honored with the naming of this year’s “class” of salmon for his many years of support and dedication to LSSU and especially the aquatic lab. He and Theresa are longtime supporters of many aspects of the university, including its Arts Center. In addition to the Barch family, LSSU welcomed longtime Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources partners at the ceremony on Friday.

Ketchikan is a great place for a fishing charter even if you are only there for the day. Your catch can be cleaned, packed, and shipped home to arrive upon your return your you can surprise family or friends. There's nothing quite like getting fish in the mail.  How did Ketchikan get its name? Its unknown even what it means. Some say it means "This river belongs to Ketch" but others claim Ketchikan refers to a thundering eagle.  People are always asking me how I made these videos with cool FX. If you're interested in how I made this video on my home computer and the software I used here is a link: http://millenniumtrail.com/Video-Editing-Software.htm  Note: This video is an original work created from photos taken on my visit to Ketchikan Alaska on a cruise. I created animations, objects and titles with photo and video editing software.

Fairmont Waterfront ~ ARC visits Haida Gwaii Chef Alessandro and our team recently visited Haida Gwaii to experience where our 100% certified Ocean Wise seafood is sourced first hand.  We had an amazing time razor clamming with renowned Haida carver Reg Davidson;  mushroom foraging with Haida carver Tyson Brown and salmon fishing with Shawn Baybutt and the crew from Haida Wild.  We were overwhelmed with the hospitality that we experienced from everyone we met and completely in awe of the raw beauty of the islands.  ARC and Fairmont Waterfront are proud to partner with Haida Wild as we work together to support sustainable fishing - our goal is to source 60% of our restaurant's seafood from the pristine waters off the shores of Haida Gwaii.

The Alexis P Suter Band "Song #1" - Salmon Arm's Roots & Blues Festival Alexis P. Suter's voice is a force of nature. When she takes to the stage, thunder rumbles, lightning bolts slice the sky, and sparks fly everywhere! When Alexis sings the blues, you know she's been there. When she sings a tender ballad, you hear her heart. And when she rocks you .... baby, that's when you get your shuga fix!   Born in Brooklyn, NY, Alexis came from a strong musical background. Her mother was a music teacher and accomplished singer who worked with such notables as Harry Belafonte, Mahalia Jackson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, and The Hall Johnson Choir. Often she would have Alexis sing in recitals and gospel plays and it wasn't long before Alexis realized that it was music and sharing it with others, that fed her soul.    Although her career is relatively new, Alexis has already toured internationally, and has shared the stage with some of the biggest names in blues. In the early 90's, she became a staple of underground garage music and the first African American woman signed to Sony-Epic in Japan. Her legendary "Slam Me Baby" distinguished her as a genuine underground star with penetrating vocals while Living Blues Magazine called, "Shuga Fix", Alexis' debut release, "fierce and fabulous". A seasoned gospel performer, Alexis is a featured vocalist with New York's acclaimed Illumination Gospel Chorale, and also solos with the Total Praise Gospel Choir. As a regular performer at the  HYPERLINK "http://www.levonhelm.com" \t "_blank" Levon Helm "Midnight Ramble Sessions" in Woodstock, NY, one of her latest releases is a phenomenal CD/DVD recorded live at the Sessions.     A true vocal phenomenon, Alexis has been astounding audiences up and down the east coast for the past few years, backed by her tight, soul-rocking ensemble. The band is anchored by Ray Grappone's funky beats and Peter Bennett on bass, while Jimmy Bennett plays stinging guitar, and soulful singers, Vicki Bell, Glenn Turner and Linda Pino, ramp up the intensity that has captured the attention of some of the best players around.     Alexis' unprecedented, universal talent connects with the heart and soul of audiences everywhere. Her larger than life stage presence radiates to the farthest niche of performance space. Keep your eyes and ears open. Shooting stars are only seen if you're paying attention.

Year on a Yukon Corner The images for this video came from the first webcam we installed in the Yukon.  I waded through a year's worth of images and selected one from each day as close to 9:00 am as I could.  This is the result.  There was no logic behind the 9:00 am choice - I'm sure other time slots would have worked well also - but there are some interesting shots (even a couple of snow plows in the "right locations" to make it look like a couple of sequential shots although they're a day apart) and some beautiful skies.  One thing is for sure - it's easy to appreciate the long winters and short summers when you can watch the snow as part of the picture in one form or another from September until May...

Veloster on a Lake (ice and snow) Check out my Veloster videos, pictures and opinions at www.velosterlover.com  I drove out to Gimli and could not resist taking my new Hyundai Veloster right out on to the ice of Lake Winnipeg.  The weather was sunny and and just below freezing,, perfect for ice fishing. I have always wanted to try ice racing and the Winnipeg Sports Car Club is scheduled to ice race on March 2,2012 at Gimli,, but I would have to buy a cheap used car for that.    Sorry there is no drifting,, there was way too much snow on the ice that I was likely to get stuck in the middle of the lake with no tow truck service.    Here are some pictures showing some of the setups I used make my Veloster videos. http://www.flickr.com/photos/74488050@N04/sets/72157629376880107/  The music is a studio recording by Gord Houghton an indy artist from Winnipeg.  This track called "Biography" is from one of his bands "Symington Yard" I used with his WRITTEN permission in exchange for giving him credit here.  Gord is supremely talented and should be making a good living from music.

As of March 2013 its my second winter driving in Winnipeg, mainly city driving on all season tires.  Overall I'm impressed with the traction control and even driving pretty aggressively I have only lost control once by suddenly deciding to turn causing a sideways slid before recovering with no collision.  I had planned on buying winter tires by now, but money always ends up getting spent on something else.  If I was doing more highway winter driving I definitely would have bought them by now.  In deep snow I have been stuck, but even a police car got stuck on one of those days.  I keep a small shovel and used it twice each winter.  Some people will buy an SUV just thinking they are better in winter,, but they are no safer being so high,, hitting the ditch they are more likely to role and to me an SUV is just a taller station wagon.  SUVs, station wagons and minivans still make me cringe ['Veloster', 'Hyundai', 'Hyundai Veloster', 'Ice Fishing', 'Gimli', 'Manitoba', 'Winter', 'Lake Winnipeg', 'Auto', '\xed\x98\x84\xeb\x8c\x80', 'USA', 'North America', 'Korea', 'South Korea', '\xeb\xb2\xa8\xeb\xa1\x9c\xec\x8a\xa4\xed\x84\xb0', 'review', 'veloster review', 'test drive', 'awesome', 'United States', 'Toronto', 'Europe', 'Cars', 'no', 'drifting', '\xe0\xb8\xae\xe0\xb8\xb8\xe0\xb8\x99\xe0\xb9\x84\xe0\xb8\x94', '\xe7\x8e\xb0\xe4\xbb\xa3', '\xec\x9d\x98\xed\x95\x9c', '\xea\xb7\xb8\xeb\xa0\x88\xec\x9d\xb4\xed\x8a\xb8', '\xec\x8b\xa0\xec\xb0\xa8', '\xeb\x8c\x80\xed\x95\x9c\xeb\xaf\xbc\xea\xb5\xad', 'snow']
The Lower Grand River Flooding at Fishmasters February 14th, 2009 The water was flowing hard and fast overnight.  With an Ice Jam holding back the flow at Port Maitland, it didn't take long for the levels to rise... Thankfully we are high and dry however the water has taken over a better part of our driveway... Some on the river side of Dunnville and Broad Street didn't fare so well... Thanks go out to the fire and police departments for doing a great job and checking in on us on a regular basis!

ice driving subaru impreza This is how I warm up the car after ice fishing.  Driving my impreza outback sport on ice is a blast.  The ice is about 18 inches, and the water around 20 feet.  Large trucks are driving on the lake so I feel my little car should be fine.  The first thing to do when driving on ice is to roll down the windows and take off your seat belt.

RC CWR jet boating the Kananaskis River with the NQD Tear Into Skye, Will and I went camping in Kananaskis country at the Mount Kidd campground for 5 days. And you know we brought the RCs for sure. We had a blast playing in an off shoot creek from the Kananaskis River that runs close to the campground. Will and Skye thought I need some other boats to play around with, so they took out the blue and red boats, they are just pool toys that they had in the toy bin. The weather was grey and a little rainy, the river was as cold as can be. But like crazy Canadians we loved every minute of it, even though our feet were numb. Good times.   RC CWR is Remote Control Chris Will Rappel. We are a father (Chris) 'n son (Will) team in Calgary Alberta, enjoying the hobby of RCs. Our collection of RCs include the crawlers Axial Wraith, Honcho SCX10, and Dingo SCX-10. For bashers we have the Traxxas Slash 2wd and Bandit. Drifter cars and or truck HPI Sprint 2 FLUZ and E-10. Scaler Tamiya F-350 and a cross over wraith axles under a bruiser chassis and body. Next are the Micro or mini Losi Trail Trekker and crawler customized 6X6 rally trucks flat beds and a short course truck. Another trekker is made into a custom 1/10 quad, with rider, for the axial scale adventures. We also have a 1/24 scale forklift from INDUSTRY FORK CAR, that helps out with our custom builds. 2 Forces of Valor tanks that are 1/16 scale and can shoot each other with infra red lights. Protocol helicopters one TOUGH Copter and one STEALTH HAWK. Pro Boat Mini -- V and a Blackjack 26 that is now a full time snow boat, weather permitting of course. Snowboating can be very hard on boats and boaters FYI. We have made custom built flat deck trailers and 5th wheels for our trucks to pull along on our journeys through the parks and trails around Calgary and area. Plus a custom camper that rides in the back of PJ the Jeep Cherokee. As much fun as they are to drive scale crawl or bash, we enjoy the building and planning of new builds just as much. Nothing can beat the feeling of pride when a father and son team test drive a custom designed and built RC. No sooner do we finish a build, we are already talking and planning the next build. A hobby the whole family can enjoy and have fun with. Thank you for joining us on our builds and trail runs in and around Calgary. Thanks for watching and enjoy, please subscribe LIKE and comment.

Jinak je to ale fajn, hlavně proto, že tohle ubytko jsem měl zadara! ...mou jedinou protislužbou bylo, že jsem vždycky večer vybafl na případně narušitele snažící se dostat na loď :)    Naštěstí tohoto dobrodružství už bude konec a já se budu moci během několika následujících dnů nastěhovat do zaměstnaneckého ubytování mého nového zaměstnavatele Hotelu Eldorádo :) ['dejw', 'dejwator', 'krnovak', 'krnovsky', 'yukon', 'jukon', 'aliaska', 'alaska', 'kanada', 'canada', 'cestovatel', 'dobrodruh', 'stopem', 'krnov']

UHC Season 7 - Episode 4: The Fishing Network Welcome back to the fishing network! Just kidding another UHC.  Welcome to UHC Season 7!   Minecraft: Ultra Hardcore is a gamemode originally created by Guude and the group Mindcrack.   In UHC mode, health does not regenerate, you must use a golden apple or instant health potion. In addition, ghasts drop gold ingots, rather than ghast tears, so players cannot brew regeneration potions.   In this season of UHC, we have 23 participants scattered across a 2500x2500 map playing solo using the Mumble plugin that adds directional audio in-game. The last remaining player is deemed the winner. The season was recorded in a single-session.   We're using a custom plugin for UHC that automatically disables PvP for the first 20 minutes and displays episode timers.   Custom plugin and hosting provided by Mineplex.com.

I love Fishing, Girl Power My name is Gina R. Cowins and I believe “Paint Emotions 4-A Cure” is the right medicine. I joined the struggle and started healing hearts by making easy transitions with colors and drawings.  We can defeat low concentration spans and temporary memory loss. Get involved today and make somebody happy.  My art share telepathy experiences into the twilight zone. I enjoy people who show their artistic abilities and create visual art.

After the usual morning watering session, Matt sends Noney off to "test the waters" and see if she can't find the perfect gift.  Previous Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9337V...  Stardew Valley is a delightful new Farm simulation RPG in a similar vein to the popular Natsume Harvest Moon series, or the Animal Crossing games, where the player takes on the role of the inheritor of an old plot of farmland in the eponymous Stardew Valley, where they are given all the tools necessary to build a life as a farmer, rancher, fisherman or even an adventurer. Befriend, even date and marry within the community, or sell the city out to the encroaching commercialism of corporate interests. The story is yours to tell.

28 6 Cabin tour, dinner of dehydrated potatoes, salmon and a fishing story Petersburg Alaska During our mid-August week long stay in Petersburg, Alaska the weather had been damp. They had just come out of a good stretch of sunny weather in the high 70's, it was in the mid to high fifties during our stay, and as I write now 10 days later Sept. 2, 2009, they are again having sunny days. There is a great web cam that refreshes every 15 seconds perched on the National Public Radio Station tower in town. KFSK radio can be search engined, click on the web cam. We began planning our vacation in May of 2009. If I did not get a daily fix of the KFSK webcam, something was wrong.   Much history of the community is available on-line, Google Earth posters have left numerous photos of the community. Recently I read that a group of advisors arriving in town representing the travel industry were trying to emphasize the eco-tourism appeal of the region. The Panhandle of Alaska is as wet as any equatorial region frequented by monsoons. From some of the other movies we have posted you can see the lush nature of just this one island of which there are literally hundreds, most of them unpopulated except by wildlife.    Real Estate in the community is "By Owner", or through a local realty group named Petersburg Realty, what else? The owner of the boat rental told us he was soon selling out his boats, and would become the owner of the realty. Properties on the island ranged from undeveloped land accessible by foot through the underbrush, to undeveloped and developed properties with and without waterfront to a variety of new to older homes, several commercial properties, boats of various sizes, and a large industrial property on the shore.   Several residents stated the loss of the logging industry, (we did note a small lumber mill in operation), and a sagging fishing revenue had produced an economic doldrums effect.  Across the street from our lodging each day we saw a representative of the self employed each day tending after his crabbing business. HIs day's activities were adjusted to the tides it seemed. Some days home in the middle of the afternoon, others not arriving until dusk. A "For Sale by Owner" sign on his two story home.   The nations economy is shouldered by people. Each one makes a contributing share however small or large. People get bye during hard times. Petersburg did have a number of storefronts for lease on main street which the Taxi Driver told us recently were occupied by various gift trade shops. The regions Fish and Game office, a Division of Forestry office, a courthouse, a rest home, hospital, Alaska Airlines Terminal with two flights daily, air tours with fixed wing and helicopter, charter fishing boats, the Coast Guard has a large vessel tied in the harbor, nine churches, a pizza parlor, a sit down restaurant perched on pilings in Middle Harbor for sale by owner, a certain population of native coastal peoples, two taverns, a hardware with seemingly every item one could need in that area of life, an old paid for supermarket on main street, and a new un-paid for supermarket half way to the airport, and a reported full time population of 3008. Much of the payroll from the three major fish processors in town flies out of town with the globally mixed seasonal workers on "the slime line". At the area of the Harbormasters office evenings the tired workers gathered along the sidewalk. Numerous languages issued from various cliques along the way. Men and women have gone to the sea for ages, no different here. The processor business comptrollers and owners have found the minimum wage half way or so between $7 and $8 and time and a half for overtime more economical than the $11 or so paid to the unionized workers who once populated the canneries.   We have not wintered in Petersburg. That it is a different season we can only imagine. Rain may fall in Spain, but Little Norway gets some too. Average rainfall is 99,99 inches. That is 8,3 feet per year. Knee high brown boots that have a cream colored trim are the native wear. Rain and snow visit Petersburg, and a long gray wet winter, with shortened daylight hours prevails.

Worst hell-hole on Earth 12 - Alberta tar sands - Close-up of a tailing "pond" and its discharges into the environment.  (Anthony Marr - www.HOPE-CARE.org) A native person told me that if I saw a duck landing into one of these tailing "ponds", I could not expect it to take off again.  This was proven when, this summer, 50 ducks landed into one of these "ponds", and all died. Note the oil-sheen on the surface and the dirty overflow on to the surroundings.

We are a father (Chris) 'n son (Will) team in Calgary Alberta, enjoying the hobby of RCs. Our collection of RCs include the crawlers Axial Wraith, Honcho SCX10, and Dingo SCX-10. Twin Hammer VW bug aka THug for scaling, bashing and hydroplaning with paddle tires on. For bashers we have the Traxxas Slash 2wd and Bandit. Drifter cars and or truck HPI Sprint 2 FLUZ and E-10. Scaler Tamiya F-350 and a cross over wraith axles under a bruiser chassis and body. Next are the Micro or mini Losi Trail Trekker and crawler customized 6X6 rally trucks flat beds and a short course truck. Another trekker is made into a custom 1/10 quad, with rider, for the axial scale adventures. We also have a 1/24 scale forklift from INDUSTRY FORK CAR, that helps out with our custom builds. 2 Forces of Valor tanks that are 1/16 scale and can shoot each other with infra red lights. Protocol helicopters one TOUGH Copter and one STEALTH HAWK. Hobby Zone Super Cub with a drop module.

We have made custom built flat deck trailers and 5th wheels for our trucks to pull along on our journeys through the parks and trails around Calgary and area. Plus a custom camper that rides in the back of PJ the Jeep Cherokee. As much fun as they are to drive scale crawl or bash, we enjoy the building and planning of new builds just as much. Nothing can beat the feeling of pride when a father and son team test drive a custom designed and built RC. No sooner do we finish a build, we are already talking and planning the next build. A hobby the whole family can enjoy and have fun with. Thank you for joining us on our builds and trail runs in and around Calgary. Thanks for watching and enjoy, please subscribe LIKE and comment.

Kayaking the Spillimacheen River Kayaking a class IV+ stretch of the Spillimacheen River in eastern British Columbia. The level was low; likely less than 9cms in the canyon (12-16cms is considered optimal). However, that was fine considering none of us had run the river before. Unfortunately, I couldn't get video of someone running every drop - there were only 3 of us and at times I had to be in my boat for safety instead of filming. It's a short (1.5km) section of river but with scouting, filming, and a bit of portaging it took us 3 hours to run.     The video shows the 7 significant rapids on the river  (no, I didn't make up the names!):  1. The dam spillway.  2. 'Birth Canal' (river-right chute through a mid-stream boulder jumble)   3. 'Astro Lube' (roostertail-riddled rock slide)  4. 'Reach Around' (sloping rock drop)  5. 'Two in the Pink' (stair-step style drop)   6. 'One in the Stink' (a.k.a. 'L drop')  7. 'Happy Ending' (20' near vertical waterfall)    Kayakers are Tom, Ben, and Dave.

Windpaddle Sail Cameron Lake Good conditions today on Cameron Lake in Tobermory for using a Windpaddle Sail on my Tempest 165 kayak. It's a downwind sail that can do moderate cross wind sailing but is best for fairly straightforward following winds. Crossed Cameron Lake entirely without paddling at about 5km/h in approximately 18km/h winds. Paddled through the small river that connects Cameron to Cyprus lake to enjoy this short little stretch as well. The paddle back was into the wind and quite enjoyable too with a few 1 foot waves being picked up by the winds.

"OtherPeoplesTrash" Skaha Lake's West side KAYAKING-LOG: May11th2013 We have beautiful lakes in the Okanagan Valley but it is sad how many take our lakes for granted. Kayaking along Skaha Lake's West side from Penticton towards Kaleden. Didn't even make it 1/3 the way and my crate was full of the trash I collected. We all need do our part to take care of our waterways before it is too late. Wish I had the room on my kayak to put all the trash on it. Styrophome, plastic, car tires, couches, chairs, trash-cans and much more. =( makes me sad that people just don't care. Our public beaches have trash cans, please use them! ~Guy   Please also watch: "When birds eats plastic!!" (Shocking video) http://youtu.be/dAL9Xvrg3hI Midway Island is an uninhabited island about 2000 km from any other coast line. It lies roughly equidistant between North America and Asia, and almost halfway around the world from England. If you think that throwing away that plastic bottle or piece of rubbish, can't possibly be doing any harm, then watch this clip and think again.  "This is sad and disgusting. Photographer Chris Jordan took pictures of dead albatrosses on the Midway Atoll, a remote cluster of islands more than 2000 miles from the nearest continent. The photos reveal a gruesome reality -- the insides of the decaying birds were filled with plastic trash.

McMahon Lake - Northern Ontario This is a short video of a kayaking trip that we took in early August of 2016.  To reach Lake McMahon (or Island Lake as some people call it) you need to get in a boat on Patten Lake, portage out from the far Southwestern edge of Patten, head up a steep incline and down into a launch area on Lake McMahon.  There are only about three properties on this lake and the water is a crystal, slate blue.

You can no nothing at all about whitewater kayaking and by the end of the week, you will be ready to run rapids. I know it sounds unbelievable, if you asked me a week ago if would be running rapids, and doing rolls, and doing all of these turns, in this whitewater? I always was like, no way, I"m not going to do that, I'll probably chicken out of half of the things... But I love the way they teach the course. They do everything in a progression.  you start off just trying to get comfortable in the kayak.  You start, doing these strokes in calm water.  And then you start doing all of these exercises where you are practicing the low brace, you're practicing the high brace, you're practicing kayaking on your side. And then eventually you are going to start working on T-rescues and wet exits and this was something I was really afraid of, going upside down in the water.  But after you do it a bunch of times, by the time you are ready to go and do that wet exit in moving water, you're feeling really calm and you're ready to wait for someone to come and get you.  And hey, soon enough you'll be able to do that roll.  Dave and I were completely surprised that by 3 days in, we both had a pretty solid roll. I did the roll, I did the roll Woo! Woohoo Something I really loved is just in front of the centre, is they have all of these gates with huge water right there. And I was thinking, there's no way we're going to run that, that's just for experts right? And then here we are 4 days in, they're going "Okay we're going to run the gates. We're going to run the rapids"  I never thought that I would be a person who could even, you know, think of floating through whitewater, let alone kayaking through it and trying to find my line, and staying upright and being ok if I do tip over.  I'm so stupid! Woohoo! So by the end of your 5 day whitewater kayaking course with Madawaska Kanu Centre, you are going to be able to take those skills that you've learned and go out and feel confident to run your own, whitewater run.   Made it! Yeah.

Indian  Rock to Okanagan Mtn. Park KAYAKING July27th2013 Great place to get one with nature ;). We paddled from Indian Rock (North of Naramata,BC on Okanagan Lake) to the Okanagan Mountain Provincial park and found our favorite little beach to relax for a day in the sun. The park has many little beaches along the Southern shoreline that are great for camping for 1 or 2 persons.

Scouting the Robson River, BC Scouting the Robson River near Mount Robson, British Columbia. Not the most exciting video, but it gives an idea of what the river looks like without driving all the way there and hiking 4 km only to find a pile of river-wide logjams that make most of this creek unrunnable.     If I ever run this river in my kayak, it'll probably only be the last 1km. Although the middle section above 'PhotoShot' is fairly free of wood, it's an awfully long hike for an awfully short section of river.

Patten Lake - Northern Ontario At the northern end of Patten Lake in Northern Ontario, Canada, you can find this gorgeous slice of tranquility.  This video was recorded during a lovely afternoon in early August of 2016.   The bird you will hear with a distinctive call is a female osprey with chicks on her nest.  An osprey has nested at the top of the same dead tree in the same spot here for years.   People sometimes wonder why my family and I drive 11 hours each summer to our cabin on this remote lake.  This is my answer.  Hope you enjoy it, too. ['Patten Lake', 'kayaking', 'osprey', 'Northern Ontario', 'Ontario', 'HD', 'GoPro', 'summer', 'lake', 'Algoma', 'Poplar Dale']

There is a world-famous standing wave that is caused during flooding, which results in some of the most dynamic waters and paddling on the planet. Named Skookumchuck by the early inhabitants (in Chinook, meaning "Strong Waters"), we see current at 9-10 knots during this filming. The TRAK performance folding kayak is tested and paddled by Jaime Sharp and Warren Williamson, alongside its equivalent hard-shell cousins. This is all part of the filming of The TRAK Files video series, produced by Wandering Wolf Productions.

Fraser River at 200cms On 1 July 2008 the Fraser River shot up to 200cms after four days of stinking hot weather ended a long, cold spring (yes, 28C is considered 'stinking hot' in Alberta). Since I was in Jasper for the Canada Day long weekend, I decided to wander west for a look, though I wisely opted not to kayak the canyon that day.

Awesome Sunset Paddle on Skaha Lake March 17th 2012 (Snowstorm to Sunset) (Long Version) (Long Version) We woke to a snowstorm that stopped about noon. Snow didn't stay, by late afternoon we managed to get our bench put together and moved it and the firepit down to the lake. Thought all was lost in the way of kayaking today but by supper the lake calmed and warmed up perfectly for a nice evening paddle on the lake. As we paddled the calm lake and headed up the Okanagan River Channel the sun began to set giving us an awesome Sunset Show. Hope you like the video!

Princess Maggie of Kamiskotia Princess Maggie Buffalo (Leclair) the daughter of a full blooded Chippewa Indian was born in Nighthawk Center, North Eastern ON. Canada. She married Bill Leclair of Kamiskotia.  A character who ran away from the old age home to escape to her cabin on the shores of Kamiskotia lake where during the plague buried a husband and 2 children on an island there.  My dad said she could skin a beaver faster than you could smoke a cigarette. There's not a trace left of Maggie but my song and there's not even a grave marker in our local cemetery. However she's (apparently) buried with her husband Bill Leclair  Shame on you Timmins.  ( NO GLORY IN THIS TOWN )  You'd think Shania Twain would take up the cause to erect a proper monument as a commemoration of her life lived here after all she's from the same town. I am personally of Cherokee blood myself from the Painted Feather Woodland Metis tribe My great grandmother's  maiden name was Marguerite Levert(Raymond) whose mother Annie St.Jean married Louis Raymond.  Margaret Lewis married Mike Levert from Cheneville or St.Andre Avelin, Province of Quebec. Canada  They were married in New York somewhere ?. Ogdensburg N.Y. ?   She was a Cherokee Indian from the North Dakota Painted Feather Woodland Metis tribe.  For a great story about Princess Maggie (Not my grandmother) go to  /A memory of Maggie Leclair by Roger Gagnon  at the Timmins Times.  Princess Maggie of Kamiskotia  There was naught but rocks and forests In our little country town And that hard rock gold miner Worked the earth without a frown  Maggie was hard yet gentle And the will and strenght she showed That she could not be beaten down By the wind and winter snows   Her face was beaten by the weather And her back was bent and sore From packing moose and children Along the old Mattagami's shore  Beside Kamiskotia mountain She'd stopped and rest awhile And drink tea from a cup of birch For she had walked many weary miles  Over her fields of wheat and corn She'd sight a flock of Geese Flying in military form So high so wild so free  She represented her culture well For a proud Indian was she Like Chief Dan George the Indian She'll go down in history  The springtime sun has melted All around as you can see Except that packed down snowshoe trail Left by Maggie and me  The years have been so many Since the day you were my bride To-day the snow falls Maggie Covering all the country side  Very soon eternal spring  Will bring back the honey bees And the waters of the river  Will dance for you and me  Chorus: Just a simple song for Maggie My life my dream come true Indian blood flows in her veins And she speaks the parlez vous  Verse: We trecked across this country In the rains through woodland green Watched the Northern Lights at midnight When the clouds had blown away  And when the night time brought us home Sleeping neath the  jack pine tree We'd bathe our feet in the morning dew Just you Maggie and me  From D to E chord  And now the great of spirits Have taken her away May the ghosts of Maggie roam these valleys In Canada's great domaine  And when her search is over May she find not ill remains Of a land that was once Indian And is the white man still to blame  Recorded at Ambience Recording Studio on Rideau Street,  Ottawa.

As such, this property endeavors to give "moments" that take your breath away!  The view is an ever changing portrait as nature, weather, season and time of day ebb and flow from one mood to another.    The main and guest house are situated in the center of the 6 acres granting 400 feet of privacy in either direction -- never to be inhabited by neighbors. The property is one of the few left in Sylvan Lake with full grandfathered riparian rights to the water's edge.  It's totally privately owned and is zoned to remain so.    The back of this lakefront acreage is wrapped in enchanting woods, delivering the peaceful tranquility of nature right outside the windows in three directions (W,N,E) from dawn to dusk and from season to season.  The front faces due south overlooking the ever altering sky, hills and lake landscapes.  The large windows and decks show off the ever changing landscape views as they transform, moment after moment, season after season, year after year.      There's really no describing it ... not without experiencing it.  And to experience it, you have to be willing to relax and to engage all senses.  You will never forget it.

Situated along the Rideau Canal it is part of the longest running Lock system, operating without pause for over one hundred and eighty years, in North America.  Tourism is what drives the Merrickville economy, to which there is more than enough to see and do in this quaint village of over 2,500 people. The actual size of Merrickville, almost 215 square kilometres, accommodates one of the largest water-based Bird Sanctuaries spanning both shores of the Rideau Canal and smaller farming communities. Travel to Merrickville is via Veterans Memorial Hwy to hwy 43 west out of Ottawa, a forty-five minute trip by car.  The attractions are the annual Jazz Fest, the Bed & Breakfast accommodations, the Blockhouse Museum, the many specialty shops and restaurants, and numerous Art Studios and galleries. In fact several of the artists live and work in the rural countryside surrounding the village, producing hot glass, jewellery, pottery, sculpture, textile arts, metal smithing and letterpress printing. For the outdoor enthusiast, and depending on the time of year, there is boating, (canoeing & kayaking), fishing, Cycling, Bird watching, Skating, snowmobiling, and Cross country Snowshoeing & Skiing. The village of Merrickville has two schools, Wolford Public and Merrickville Public.   If you are searching for a home in a community that offers the laid-back lifestyle, a rural and historic setting, then Merrickville has what you are looking for.  http://www.ottawaliving.ca/community.php?community_id=195 ['Ottawa (City/Town/Village)', 'Merrickville-Wolford (City/Town/Village)', 'real estate', 'houses', 'homes', 'condos']

Preferred Professionals - Dockside Music Art A locally-owned music lessons studio and instrument store in Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia.  The community of Eastern Passage, on the Atlantic Eastern shore, is one of the oldest fishing villages in North America. It's less than 15 minutes from the bridges spanning the harbour between Halifax and Dartmouth. Today it has developed into a lovely community with a small-town feel, and interestingly, manages to integrate a working fishing village into a must-see village stroll popular with both tourists and locals who want to escape the city.

3477 Douses Road Belle River PEI House for sale Stunning Waterfront Property with Apple Orchard Available!! Originally this home was built for Lord Selkirk on PEI’s original Lot 62. When current Vendors purchased the property 25 years ago and being the 8th owners of the property, the once old farm house has been completely transformed/refurbished into the beautiful sight you will see today. The concrete foundation replaced the once upon a time island stone but the pieces of history have been preserved and used to accent this picturesque property with even the Great Wall of Belle River built at the back from the original stones. The old chicken coupe was transformed into the lovely looking cottage/shop which is left for the new owner’s interpretation and usage to finish the space inside. The property borders the Belle River which the owners use to fish for trout to impress their guests for morning breakfast. The home itself has been completely reconfigured for functionality of the space while preserving the integrity and character of the home. Everything within this home has been updated from plumbing, wiring, re-drywalled, new kitchen, bathrooms, roof has been re-shingled twice throughout the years and so much more.

PEI CREA MLS (realtor.ca) Description:  11977 Route #6 Margate  Most houses are just a place to live, a kitchen, a living room, and some bathrooms. This home is a lifestyle of fun, freedom, and constant entertainment! The experience begins with a short drive up a twisty driveway to the top of a hill where you can see for many miles. Your new Prince Edward Island Home is situated on almost 5 acres of land with the ability to buy much more as an option potentially making this a fabulous hill top estate. If you are a handyman, or you just like to escape to the workshop, then you will find a massive detached garage workshop large enough to park a tractor-trailer. Entering the home from the side entrance you have a woodworking shop, and an extra-large double garage. Nothing in your new home is small in scale – not the rooms, hallways, master suite, or common areas. If you would like your new home biggy-sized, then this is for you!

"27 mai 2008 : Hello Abitibi " Travellingjon's photos around Val-d'Or, Canada Preview of Travellingjon's blog at TravelPod. Read the full blog here: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/travellingjon/5/1211900400/tpod.html    This blog preview was made by TravelPod using the TripAdvisor™ TripWow slideshow creator.    Entry from: Val-d'Or, Canada  Entry Title: "27 mai 2008 : Hello Abitibi !"    Entry:    "Départ beaucoup plus tard que prévu, aujourd'hui ; après m'être débarrassé de mon dilemme de félin double (je suis allé mener mes chats à l'animalerie pour la semaine), j'ai tenté de rattraper mon retard, créé par une nuit plus longue que prévue, mais ô combien reposante. Et hop, vers onze heures, l'auto est pleine de mes trucs (y compris une chaude douillette, au cas où je mettrais mon plan de dormir dans mon fidèle Sebring à exécution), et je sors de Chibougamau.    Après avoir mis quelques litres d'essence hors de prix dans mon véhicule, je vois un jeune homme sur le bord de la route 113, en train de faire du pouce en direction de Chapais (et par conséquent, de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue, vers où je me dirige) ; me souvenant, une amère larme de nostalgie au coin de l'oeil, de mes propres aventures en tant que "hitch hiker" en France en 2006, je n'écoute que mon courage et ma bonté, et fais signe au mec en question (il s'appelle Kevin) qu'il peut monter, lui et toutes ses affaires, dans mon fidèle Sebring. Je viens de me faire non seulement un compagnon de voyage, mais également un guide routier touristique : Kevin a déjà resté à Lebel-sur-Quévillon, sur notre chemin, et il demeure présentement à Rouyn-Noranda, en Abitibi. Je le dépose donc à la fin de mon trajet pour la journée, soit Val-d'Or.    Sur la route 113, rien n'est égal ; non seulement rien ne se ressemble d'un kilomètre à l'autre, mais en plus nous avons toutes les températures, en cette fin de mai : pluie faible, pluie forte, grêle, nuages menaçants, vent, soleil. Plusieurs fois, je dois ralentir pour pouvoir conduire d'une façon digne de ce mot. Et c'est sans compter les petits villages que nous rencontrons, dont certains font franchement pitié (je ne spécifierai pas le(s)quel(s), pour ne pas offusquer personne) : la communauté Crie de Waswanipi, et les minuscules postes de Desmaraisville et Miquelon (voir photos) ; ces deux derniers ont moins de 50 habitants permanents. Un peu avant 14 heures, nous arrivons à Lebel-sur-Quévillon, frontière du Nord-du-Québec et de l'Abitibi, du côté NDQ ; nous y faisons un arrêt, surtout que Kevin désire aller dire un p'tit bonjour à sa maman chérie avant de continuer. Re-départ vers 14h30.    À partir de là, aucun arrêt jusqu'à Val-d'Or ; en fait, il n'y a pas grand-chose à voir entre les deux. C'est vrai, la route est plus belle, les arbres plus colorés et la température plus clémente, mais les 425 km qui séparent Chibougamau de ma destination finale commencent à me peser. Nous arrivons enfin à Val-d'Or juste avant le souper. Je dépose Kevin près de chez un de ses amis, et je me réserve une chambre d'hôtel tout près du centre-ville, au Prélude, un 3 étoiles sympathique (eh oui, j'ai laissé tomber mon projet hippie de dormir dans mon fidèle Sebring ce soir, mais ça m'a quand même coûté 93 balles...). Après souper, au McDo, beurk, je pars digérer tout ça en marchant un peu danns Val-d'Or. La ville n'est pas impressionnante ni exagérément belle, mais elle a un certain dynamisme ; elle m'a fait un peu penser à Chicoutimi et Alma (Saguenay Lac). Bref, je suis content d'être arrivé, et j'aime bien mon premier contact avec l'Abitibi à vie. Je me couche plutôt tôt (vers les 22 heures), question d'être le moindrement frais pour le lendemain matin ; en soirée, j'ai écouté "Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain", pour la énième fois, sur mon lecteur DVD portatif. Le confort de la maison, en voyage. Demain, 489 kilomètres, dont plus de 275 dans le Parc de la Vérendrye m'attendent."

RC CWR Canadian Ice Drifting with HPI Flux Sprint 2, E-10 and Vaterra Cop Car The kids and I took the drifters out with onroad touring tires for some ice drifting at our local skating park. Will and I traded back and forth with the red truck HPI Sprint 2 and Vaterra cop car while Skye was driving the white Dodge HPI E-10. The stock Vaterra tires worked awesome on the ice and handled the best, going to have to get some for the other 2 trucks for sure. If anyone knows of a good touring tire for ice let me know thanks. Half way through the video we head up to the bike path for some high speed runs and snow bashing. We all had a blast and it was nice to get out the drifters again.

Paull River - The Long Way In August 2015 our family (Tom, Deb, Rohan and Ruth) joined another family (Thomas, Sara, Aria, Gaby and Maya) for a three-week canoe trip into the wilderness of Saskatchewan and back again. The children ranged in age from just turned 2 to just turned 12.  Our goal was to get to the Paull River without the use of an airplane, but like many adventures the best part of it all wasn't what we thought it would be.  Our route started at Besnard Lake and headed north, through Besnard Creek, the Churchill River at Black Bear Island Lake, then into Sandy River and on towards the Paull River just downstream of Paull Lake. From there we followed the trade route back to the Churchill and on towards Missinipe.  The journey to the Paull took almost two weeks and ended up being the highlight of the trip despite being mostly upstream and lake travel with many portages, many of which were grown over pretty good from decades of disuse. The cruise down the Paull and onto the Churchill, with its established portages and whitewater was fun of course but we finished the trip longing for the unbeaten path.

A "Day" in Nova Scotia, Canada, via DJI Phantom 3 drone Experience a "day" in stunningly beautiful Nova Scotia, Canada, from sunrise to sunset.  It is absolutely amazing how much this province has to offer... rugged yet gentle, exciting yet serene, modern yet historical.  This is how I have experienced Nova Scotia over a six-month period.  It is not intended to fully capture the province, as there are MANY parts I've yet to visit.  However, the video is intended to be only one in a series of "A 'Day' in Nova Scotia" videos that I will be continuing on this YouTube channel.  The footage was recorded between June and December 2015, and was shot using a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone.  Subscribe to our channel to get the latest videos posted for our Nova Scotia Lighthouse Project (we're working to capture all 175 of them in the province!), and check out the other lighthouse and travel videos we currently have airing.

Next of course will be the body and paint, not sure what we are going to do but we have a few ideas.   Kevin MacLeod Whiskey on the Mississippi / Slow Burn incompetech.com  RC CWR is Remote Control Chris Will Rappel. We are a father (Chris) 'n son (Will) team in Calgary Alberta, enjoying the hobby of RCs. Our collection of RCs include the crawlers Axial Wraith, Honcho SCX10, and Dingo SCX-10. For bashers we have the Traxxas Slash 2wd and Bandit. Drifter cars and or truck HPI Sprint 2 FLUZ and E-10. Scaler Tamiya F-350 and a cross over wraith axles under a bruiser chassis and body. Next are the Micro or mini Losi Trail Trekker and crawler customized 6X6 rally trucks flat beds and a short course truck. Another trekker is made into a custom 1/10 quad, with rider, for the axial scale adventures. We also have a 1/24 scale forklift from INDUSTRY FORK CAR, that helps out with our custom builds. 2 Forces of Valor tanks that are 1/16 scale and can shoot each other with infra red lights. Protocol helicopters one TOUGH Copter and one STEALTH HAWK. Pro Boat Mini -- V and a Blackjack 26 that is now a full time snow boat, weather permitting of course. Snowboating can be very hard on boats and boaters FYI. We have made custom built flat deck trailers and 5th wheels for our trucks to pull along on our journeys through the parks and trails around Calgary and area. Plus a custom camper that rides in the back of PJ the Jeep Cherokee. As much fun as they are to drive scale crawl or bash, we enjoy the building and planning of new builds just as much. Nothing can beat the feeling of pride when a father and son team test drive a custom designed and built RC. No sooner do we finish a build, we are already talking and planning the next build. A hobby the whole family can enjoy and have fun with. Thank you for joining us on our builds and trail runs in and around Calgary. Thanks for watching and enjoy, please subscribe LIKE and comment.

Kamloops Lake - Unusual Helicopter Maneuvers Kamloops Lake in British Columbia, Canada is situated on the Thompson River just west of Kamloops. The lake is 1.6 km wide, 29 km long, and up to 152 m deep. The community of Savona is located at the west end of the lake on the Thompson River. The city of Kamloops is located a few miles east of the head of the lake, at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers.  The lake is bounded on all sides by steep embankments, with level areas found only near creek deltas and around the inlet and outlet. The surrounding land is mostly uninhabited. It is classified as dry belt interior grasslands, composed of bunchgrass and sagebrush with pockets of Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine and spruce.  Kamloops Lake is a widening and deepening of the Thompson River, which enters at the east end and exits at the west end. The limnology of the lake is controlled by the Thompson River, which has large fluctuations in annual flow, with over 60% occurring in the early summer during freshet (May to July). Lake levels rise naturally as much as 30 feet (9.1 m) from high season in June compared to low season. Conversely, beach areas expand by as much as 200 feet (61 m) in the summer as lake levels recede after freshet.  Bulk residence times are very short (the time it takes for the water in the lake to be replaced with new water), ranging from 20 days to 340 days, with a mean of 60 days. Because Kamloops Lake is fed by both the North and South Thompson rivers (the South Thompson drains from the very warm Shuswap Lakes), Kamloops Lake is a very warm lake. Since the late twentieth century, it has become an increasingly popular boating and recreational area. On the north side of the lake is Fredrick, and on the south side of the lake are residential subdivisions such as Cherry Creek and the Tobiano resort community. A boat launch, trestle and gas dock have been built at Tobiano; it is the only location on Kamloops Lake with these facilities. Both Savona and Kamloops also have boat launches, but their use is limited in the later summer months of low water.

Helicopter Flight - Saskatchewan, Canada. READ BEFORE VIEWING.  Video Clip of a Ride in a Schweizer 300c Helicopter flying over a Safari/Game Park/Farm near Maidstone, Saskatchewan.  The Camera wobble was unavoidable due to the Helicopter recently acquiring a couple of new Rotor Blades and as hard as I tried I couldn't avoid the camera wobble when trying to zoom in on animals.  The Bird flying is a Bald Eagle and numerous Whitetail & Mule deer can be seen as well as Wapiti/Elk, Buffalo and Sheep. Also some footage of us chasing a Coyote. Many thanks to the family who own the premises and Helicopter for their wonderful hospitality as well as a fantastic ride in a Helicopter which was a first for my wife.

Entry from: Yellowknife, Canada  Entry Title: "Yellowknife"    Entry:    "Yellowknife    Après ma première journée de mon périple de 2 semaines dans l'ouest canadien passée dans les aéroports et les avions de 7h heure de Montréal à 2h30 le lendemain matin heure de Yellowknife (-2h par rapport à Montréal)!!, j'ai enfin réussi à atteindre Yellowknife à 2h30 du mat dimanche où Steph lui avait réussi à arriver dès 14h samedi! (Résumé de la journée galère : au lieu de faire une réservation Montréal-Yellowknife directe, j'avais fait l'erreur de prendre 2 résa Montréal-Calgary / Calgary-Yellowknife ; m'étant rendu compte de cette potentielle source de problème, je l'ai mentionné à l'enregistrement à Montréal où on m'a dit qu'ils pouvaient rien faire et que je devrais sortir mes bagages à Calgary et les réenregistrer... Moi évidemment, j'ai pas insisté puisqu'elles avaient l'air catégorique... Grave erreur!... Ce contre-temps ainsi qu'une 1/2h de retard dû au vent m'a fait rater ma connexion à Calgary que Steph lui a réussi à prendre de justesse ... J'ai ensuite passé une heure avec un adorable agente à Calgary pour récupérer cette erreur des Montréalaises qui auraient en fait, paraît-il, totalement pu m'éviter ça (ça a été long du fait du pass au sein duquel on ne peut rien annuler sans encourir des frais et qui est nouveau donc les agents savent pas trop encore comment le gérer)... Bref, je me suis retrouvée à devoir prendre un vol Calgary-Edmonton (déjà en retard d'1h à cause du temps dans les Prairie) puis Edmonton-Yellowknife qui s'est avéré en retard de 4 heures (du fait d'un problème de pare-brise qui les a fait chercher un autre avion ailleurs... et puis, (histoire de bien éprouver ma patience remarquable ce jour-là, faut quand même l'avouer) un manque de personnel à minuit et quelque à Edmonton pour charger les bagages dans l'avion).... Bref arrivée à 2h30 du mat à Yellowknife.... mais au moins, j'ai pu faire tout mon travail dans les divers aéroports... Vive Air Canada ;-) Donc ce matin, dodo et puis on est allé chercher un resto par -38°C (ressenti -45°C!!)... oui oui... on est un peu débiles... voir les photos ci-dessous :) :) :) On est revenu à l'hôtel pour s'organiser notre journée de demain (voir plus bas) et puis on est ressorti se promener dans la neige et on a traversé le lac gelé pour aller jusqu'à la "vieille" ville où on a finit dans un bistro/resto de pêcheurs réputé ici (pas traditionnel comme on pourrait l'imaginer mais couvert de photos de jeunes touristes un peu fous, de blagues (du genre "Personne n'est parfait... je suis Personne") et tenu par des lesbiennes... toute une expérience) Après retour énergique pour braver la température et livraison de mes boulos pour demain matin heure de Dublin! Programme de demain : sortie en traineau à chiens de midi et quelques à 16h puis soirée aurores boréales de 20h à minuit dans un village avec des tipis et des fauteuils chauffants!! On vous racontera!! Il devrait faire moins froid quand même demain, car aujourd'hui, il n'y avait même pas de sortie traineau à chieins car il faisait trop froid! On doit aussi, avant de partir ou entre les deux sorties, manger avec une fille de Yellowknife rencontrée dans l'avion et qui m'a déposé à l'hôtel à 2h du matin avec son chum... les retards dans les avions, ça crée des liens.... :) Photos de Yellowknife (pour les novices, c'est dans les Territoires-du-Nord-Ouest, à 2h en avion au nord de Calgary... le grand nord canadien pratiquement la même latitude que Whitehorse dans le Yukon en fait)    Comme je suis arrivée à 2h30 du mat, inutile de vous dire que j'ai rien vu du tout de Yellowknife en arrivant... Ce matin, je tire mes rideaux et première image de Yellowknife (pour les novices, c'est 2h en avion au nord de Calgary... le grand nord canadien à la même latitude que Whitehorse en fait:    Un peu plus tard (14h, si si... le soleil va pas bien haut ici...) sur les "dunes" qui bordent le lac...    Grand lac de l'Esclave (big Slave's lake)     Mais puisque je vous dis que c'est un loup!! Il était tout seul, avait plus que 3 pattes... enfin bon... on saura jamais.... mais ça ressemble bien quand même....    Portraits de gens un peu fêlés.... :) ..."

Saskatchewan is not a huge tourist province. It's pretty much all the same; flat. I guess sometimes the flat is broken by "slightly lumpy". Most of the Cities have by pass routes that keep you away from the better parts of the City when driving through. I've been amazed at Cities that I've driven through a dozen times, when I've strayed from the normal route. One radio commercial trying to attract people to (or rather, keep people in) Saskatchewan has a line that goes: "just because most of us come from small towns, doesn't mean that we are all hicks". I found that amusing. I managed to find the "" ...    - "Sunset on the birthday girl's day" by Travelingcanada from a blog titled "What's that noise?"

But not being in a hurry has advantages and we opted to detour south a bit to see what Last Mountain Lake had to offer. Strasbourg was our last stop in town before heading in to find camping so we stopped for some ice cream and some very homemade and very yummy peanut butter pie.

Get your paws off my beaver - Senator Nicole Eaton YouTube Conservative Senator Nicole Eaton wants to replace the beaver as Canada's national animal emblem. What's wrong with the beaver? What's the beaver ever done to her? Beavers are good, Canadians love their beaver. Beavers are cute and furry. I like the beaver.    Dam building can be very beneficial in restoring wetlands. Such wetland benefits include flood control downstream, biodiversity (by providing habitat for many rare as well as common species), and water cleansing, both by the breakdown of toxins such as pesticides and the retention of silt by beaver dams. Over the eons, this collection of silt produces the rich bottom land so sought after by farmers. Beaver dams reduce erosion as well as decrease the turbidity that is a limiting factor for much aquatic life. While beavers can create damage, part of the problem is one of perception and time scale.     A beaver dam has a certain amount of freeboard above the water level. When heavy rains occur, the pond fills up and the dam gradually releases the extra stored water. Often this is all that is necessary to reduce the height of the flood wave moving down the river, and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures. Flood control is achieved in other ways as well. The surface of any stream intersects the surrounding water table. By raising the stream level, the gradient of the surface of the water table above the beaver dam is reduced, and water near the beaver dam flows more slowly into the stream. This further helps in reducing flood waves, and increases water flow when there is no rain. Beaver dams also smooth out water flow by increasing the area wetted by the stream. This allows more water to seep into the ground where its flow is slowed. This water eventually finds its way back to the stream. Rivers with beaver dams in their head waters have lower high water and higher low water levels    Beaver ponds can cause the removal of nutrients from the stream flow. Farming along the banks of rivers often increases the loads of phosphates, nitrates and other nutrients, which can cause eutrophication and may contaminate drinking water. Besides silt, the beaver dam collects twigs and branches from the beavers' activity and leaves, notably in the fall. The main component of this material is cellulose, a polymer of β-glucose monomers (This creates a more crystalline structure than is found in starch, which is composed of α-glucose monomers. Cellulose is a type of polysaccharide.) Many bacteria produce cellulase which can split off the glucose and use it for energy. Just as algae get their energy from sunlight, these bacteria get their energy from cellulose, and they form the base of a very similar food chain. However, a source of energy is not enough for growth. These bacterial populations face serious shortages of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, and will absorb these nutrients as they pass by in the water stream. In this way, these and other nutrients are fixed into the beaver pond and the surrounding ecology, and are removed from the stream.    Agriculture also introduces herbicides and pesticides into streams. Some of these toxicants are metabolized and decomposed by the bacteria in the cellulose-rich bottom of a beaver dam.    A Canadian ecologist has discovered the world's largest beaver dam in a remote area of northern Alberta, an animal-made structure so large it is visible from space.    Researcher Jean Thie said Wednesday he used satellite imagery and Google Earth software to locate the dam, which is about 850 meters (2,800 feet) long on the southern edge of Wood Buffalo National Park.    Average beaver dams in Canada are 10 to 100 meters long, and only rarely do they reach 500 meters.      music by 01 - zero-project - 01 - Land of legends ['Beaver', 'National', 'Animal', 'Canada', 'Senator', 'Nicole', 'Eaton', 'marshes', 'preservation', 'Wood', 'Buffalo', 'Park', 'beaver', 'dam', 'Disappearing', 'Wetlands', 'migration', 'route', 'protection', 'Freshwater', 'management', 'restoration', 'program', 'reserve', 'wetlands', 'River', 'Creek', 'Agriculture', 'herbicides', 'pesticides', 'toxicants', 'nitrogen', 'phosphorus', 'birds', 'fish', 'insects', 'flood', 'environment', 'rodent', 'breaking', 'news', 'camping', 'Rving', 'last', 'minute', 'cheap', 'vacation', 'guide', 'package', 'trip', 'YOLO', 'JCVdude', 'Sony', 'HDR', '3D', 'TD10', 'AX2000', 'HD', 'nature', 'tourism', 'destination', 'review', 'videographer']

Temagami 8 Day Canoe Trip - Part 2 of 2 (2009) This is the footage taken from an eight day canoe trip I did with a friend of mine in the Temagami region in Ontario, Canada.  It was my first trek in Temagami and it proved to be a tough go but worth every effort. It's worth noting that a good chunk of the trip wasn't actually in a park at all, hence some difficult portages.  The route involved about 41 lakes and rivers and I have a full one hour trip log in the wings that I will likely be posting on a future date to help anyone who would like to do this same trip or sections of it.  To outline the loop we did, some of the bodies of water involved - starting with: Red Squirrel Lake, Eagle Lake, Sir Devon Lake, Lady Evelyn Lake, Sucker Gut Lake, Lady Evelyn River  - South Channel, Diamond Lake, Sharp Rock Inlet and back to Red Squirrel Lake.

Entry from: Terrace Bay, Canada  Entry Title: "Parc Sleeping Giant jusqu'"    Entry:    "*** ENGLISH BELOW ***    Parc Sleeping Giant jusqu'à Terrace Bay, ON    Bon matin du parc Sleeping Giant! Quel superbe endroit ici, je me sens vraiment gâtée d'avoir ma petite plage privée (même si c'est juste 30FT de plage). Au loin je pense qu'on est supposés voir un géant couché. Je me suis bien imaginé qu'un tel site devait être populaire alors me je suis rendue au kiosque d'enregistrement mais malheureusement, quelqu'un avait réservé mon site pour ce soir. J'ai demandé si celui d'à côté était également réservé, oui, l'autre d'après, oui, oui, oui, donc, l'ado de 16 ans derrière le comptoir ne semblait aucunement motivée à me trouver un autre terrain de camping alors j'ai décidé de plier bagage et aller dormir plus loin. De toute façon j'ai mon site jusqu'à 2PM et ensuite je peux aller faire de la randonnée.    J'ai enfin découvert qui est le roi de la plage ici (je trouvais ça bizarre aussi qu'il n'y ait ni insectes, ni oiseaux, ni mammifères...) - j'ai trouvé la réponse après que la majorité des campeurs soit partie et lorsque l'équipe de nettoyage est arrivée - les canards! Ils se promenaient de site en site et mangeaient tout ce qu'ils pouvaient trouver, lorsqu'ils m'ont aperçu ils sont tout de suite venus me voir, mais ce n'était pas des canards terroristes, ils sont partis quand je leur ai dit de s'en aller. Je les ai observés dans leur tâche pas très ardue de se goinfrer de site de camping en site de camping. Je le savais qu'il devait y avoir un roi de la plage (ou des reines).    Une fois bien installée tranquillement sur la plage avec mon café et un de mes super magaines, je me suis fait amie avec un canard qui est calmement venu s'installer à côté de moi pour faire sa longue toilette personnelle, après quoi il s'est endormi tout près de moi, presque comme un animal de compagnie. Son frère ou sa soeur est venu me voir aussi, par contre ce canard là était plus actif et il m'a fait sa plus belle face de quêteux - j'ai dû le faire s'en aller de quelques mouvements de la main, ce qui a réveillé mon nouvel ami qui s'en est allé lui aussi. Je me suis même permis une petite baignade dans le lac (pas une grande baignade, je n'aime pas trop ça jouer dans l'eau). Moi, dans un lac, toute seule! Que je m'étonne des fois! La seule raison (les seules devrais-je dire) c'est que le lac était super clair, propre, pas profond, et très chaud! C'est très rate que je me plonge dans l'eau (comme vous commencer à le savoir, je suis une poltronne dans ben des situations, incluant les lacs profonds et noirs).    Il était déjà le temps de partir! Je me suis arrêtée au centre d'information pour avoir des suggestions, et j'y ai appris qu'il y avait une mine d'argent abandonnée tout près, à Silver Inslet. Cette mine était située sur un tout petit bout de terre et se trouvait sous l'eau, à 381m (1250FT) de profondeur - c'était même pendant un certain temps la mine d'argent la plus riche au monde. La mine était difficile d'accès, il était difficile de fournir un logement pour tous les mineurs, la seule source d'air dans la mine venaient de tuyaux qui sortaient à la surface de l'eau, les bottes à cap d'acier n'existaient pas encore, et la seule lumière disponible dans la mine était à la lueur des chandelles!!! Quand même, entre 1868 et 1884 la mine a produit pour 3.25M$ d'argent, un très grande richesse dans ce temps là. En voyant la mine des airs (par des photos) jamais on ne dirait qu'il y a un si grand trésor caché sous l'eau! Je suis allée au magasin général de ce temps-là, et j'ai résisté à la tentation des belles grosses tartes cuisinées sur place. J'avais l'intention d'aller marcher, pas d'aller faire une sieste après m'être gavée!    Je m'en allais ..."

Temagami 8 Day Canoe Trip - Part 1 of 2 (2009) This is the footage taken from an eight day canoe trip I did with a friend of mine in the Temagami region in Ontario, Canada.  It was my first trek in Temagami and it proved to be a tough go but worth every effort.  The route involved about 41 lakes and rivers and I have a full one hour trip log in the wings that I will likely be posting on a future date to help anyone who would like to do this same trip or sections of it.  To outline the loop we did, some of the bodies of water involved - starting with: Red Squirrel Lake, Eagle Lake, Sir Devon Lake, Lady Evelyn Lake, Sucker Gut Lake, Lady Evelyn River  - South Channel, Diamond Lake, Sharp Rock Inlet and back to Red Squirrel Lake.

It's sad to see our beautiful Province burning up, these fires leave a legacy that extends beyond the immediate destruction.  Anyone living here can see that the nature of our forests are changing as the pine beetle and wildfires do their damage.   Where once mighty pine and fir trees grew, now in their place poplars and willows are growing.   What will it all look like in 20 - 50 years.

Bay of Fundy, Maitland, Nova Scotia - Canada HD Travel Channel The Bay of Fundy located between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick is known for the world's highest tides. Low tide and high tide in the Bay of Fundy can be watched particularly well at Maitland nearby Truro. The highest tides of all times with 21 m was measured here. Depending on lunar phases and the seasons the tides during our visit was at about 14 m. At low tide, the landscape is wide and open; high tide pushes the sea further into the bay. The changes of the landscape in a very short time is really amazing and this happens twice a day.  In the video we show several times the same stretch of coastline twice; once at low tide and once at high tide.  At high tides it is popular to do rafting in the onrushing wave. The sunset's spectacular play of colours can be best viewed from the water.  We find a cozy accommodation in Captain Douglas House. The friendly family house is a heritage designated property built in 1860, by a sea captain named Captain William Douglas. For the first time we make the acquaintance  to the Canadian mosquito in Maitland which has spared us on our trip through eastern Canada till now. ..... please read more: https://blog.myvideomedia.com   Die Bay of Fundy, eine Bucht zwischen Nova Scotia und New Brunswick,  ist bekannt für den höchsten Tidenhub der Welt.  Bei Maitland, in der Nähe von Truro, lassen sich Ebbe und Flut der Bay of Fundy besonders gut beobachten. Hier wurde der höchste Tidenhub aller Zeiten mit 21 m gemessen. Abhängig von Mondphasen und der Jahreszeit, ist der Tidenhub während unserem Besuch bei etwa 14 m. Bei Niedrigwasser wirkt die Landschaft weit und offen, bei Flut drängt das Meer immer weiter in die Buchten. Es ist erstaunlich, welchen Veränderungen die Landschaft in kürzester Zeit unterworfen ist und dies zweimal täglich. Im Video zeigen wir öfters die gleichen Küstenabschnitte zweimal hintereinander; einmal bei Ebbe und einmal bei Flut. Bei Flut ist es beliebt, in der hereinbrechenden Welle, Rafting zu betreiben. Gleichzeitig lässt sich vom Wasser aus am besten das Farbenspiel der untergehenden Sonne beobachten. Wir finden eine gemütliche Unterkunft im Captain Douglas House. Die freundliche Familienpension ist ein altes Kapitänshaus, erbaut 1860 vom Kapitän zur See William Douglas. In Maitland machen wir zum ersten Mal die Bekanntschaft der kanadischen Stechmücke, die uns auf unserer Reise durch den Osten Kanadas bisher überall verschont hatte. ......

One night at Ricardo's We met Sue and Ricardo, owner operators of Ricardos Mediterranean Kitchen in Winfield BC on Wednesday. We returned Thursday night and you could have knocked me over with a feather. This place was packed. We talked with several customers and nothing but praise was said. Quality, value, service, atmosphere and a friendly environment does work. What a novel approach.  One last thing, homeowners on shows like 'House Hunters' are always looking for homes with large modern kitchens, with an Island if possible. They need space for cooking. The Kitchen where Ricardo performs his magic is perhaps 4 feet wide by 12 feet long, so it goes to show that it's not the size of your kitchen that counts, it's the love of cooking.   Gordon Ramsey, the challenge, should you except, is spend a busy night in this kitchen preparing several hundred dishes, then you will know a real Hell Kitchen.

lac la biche The Lac La Biche region has a long and colourful history. Famous explorer and mapmaker David Thompson travelled through the region in 1798 on his way to find the elusive Northwest Passage. The Hudson’s Bay Company established a fort at Lac La Biche in 1799 and Oblate Catholic priests officially established Lac La Biche Mission in 1853. The mission is now a popular National Historic Site, located 16 kilometres northwest of present day Lac La Biche.  The County is famous for its many lakes, most notably Lac La Biche Lake, which is a French translation of a Cree phrase, meaning "Lake of the Elk". In addition to lakes, rivers and streams, the County's topography features forests, farmland, muskeg, and dozens of recreation areas and trails.  Lac La Biche is the second-oldest established community in Alberta and has one of the oldest Metis settlements in Alberta, along with Lac St. Anne, St. Albert and St. Paul De Metis. The region was an ideal place to develop trade and communities because of its strategic access to the Churchill and Mackenzie drainage basins, abundant wildlife, fertile soil, pristine environment and good transportation routes - first by water and then by rail and roads.  Home to Aboriginal people for thousands of years, settlement in Lac La Biche brought together a multicultural mixture of ethnic groups, anchored by Cree, English, French, Italian, Lebanese, Metis, Russian and Ukrainian populations. While much of Lac La Biche County has French Canadian origins, the hamlets of Venice and Hylo were established as Italian agricultural colonies. The region has one of the largest Muslim populations per capita in Canada. When the  Al Kareem Mosque was constructed in 1958, it was only the second one in Canada.  Lac La Biche County was created in 2007 when the Town of Lac La Biche and Lakeland County amalgamated. It is one of the largest municipal districts in Alberta and is adjacent to four Aboriginal communities: Beaver Lake Cree Nation, Heart Lake First Nation, Kikino Metis Settlement and Buffalo Lake Metis Settlement. In addition, it has two urban centres - Lac La Biche and Plamondon – and many smaller hamlets and rural subdivisions.  The region boasts thriving agriculture, oil and gas, forestry, tourism and service industries, and has a wide variety of amenities and services for all age groups. The area is rich in natural resources, particularly oil and gas in the northeast portion of the County, which is a major economic driver. The energy industry is leading the way in economic growth and fuelling a bright, prosperous future for the County and its residents. ['canada', 'alberta', 'teravel', 'holiday', 'fun', 'camping']

Grundy Lake Provincial Park We stayed here for a couple of days before our 1st trip down the French River. We were going do backcountry here but the sites were either swampy, too close, or overgrown. We did how ever get to practice some map reading and portaging. We paddled Grundy, Gut, and Gird Lakes on the Monday. With 2 portages totalling 125 m  and the cliffs on Gut Lake ( the kids are cliff jumping ) it was an enjoyable 30 degree day. The scenery was beautiful too many people for our liking although ten years ago when our 3 boys were younger we could have easily spent a week here without ever being bored. Tuesday we drove to the Lake Pakeshkag access  paddled through from here to a 10 m portage into  Sicle Lake then a short paddle came to a 160 m portage over railway ( Don't stick around on the tracks blind corners and fast trains) down into Rapidfoot Lake the falls here are really pretty and being the only ones to carry our canoe over the hill after leaving the falls area we had Rapidfoot Lake to ourselves we paddled a short distance 2 km up Pakeshkag River water was shallow and many beaver dams we returned to Rapidfoot  and explored the island. Grundy Lake Provincial Park is a great spot for an introduction to backcountry canoeing well still being close to help if you were to need it or forget something. Grundy does have one bad point that is the close proximity to both Highway 69 ( don't stay on Clear Lake it is directly across from 69 ) and two busy railway lines on its south and east boarders ( The backcountry campsite on Rapidfoot Lake is 500 m from busy railway with long freights all hours ) ['Grundy Lake', 'Ontario Provincial Park', 'canoeing', 'camping', 'canada', 'wilderness', 'nature', 'outdoors', 'hiking', 'weekend', 'holiday']

French River Expedition http://frontierbushcraft.com/expeditions/canoe-canada-french-river/  The Frontier Bushcraft French River Expedition combines a superb journey on a Canadian Heritage River with comprehensive instruction in skills for travelling, camping and staying safe in this environment.  The trip starts with a orientation and training phase spanning a couple of days.  We then set out on an 8-day journey which includes spending two days with The Dokis First Nation, learning more about the land and their traditional view of it.  The French River is one of the most important waterways in the history of Canada. A travel route of the Ojibwa serving as a conduit for explorers and missionaries, the French River later became a key link in the fur trade.   The area provides great opportunities for employing canoe and bushcraft skills. Indeed, in this environment, they fit together perfectly.  The French River expedition is Frontier Bushcraft's foundation-level Canadian canoeing trip. The trip is led by canoe legend Ray Goodwin and renowned bushcraft instructor Paul Kirtley.  As well as giving you all the skills you need to make your own journeys here, the trip provides a firm basis for our more demanding and remote canoe expeditions such as on the Bloodvein River.   On the Frontier Bushcraft French River Expedition you can expand, hone and integrate your bushcraft and expedition canoeing skills with solid experience and expert guidance.

Calgary to Vancouver Island in Winter - time lapse - part 3 of 7 This is the third video of my trip out to Vancouver Island.  As I was leaving Alberta we were experiencing chinook conditions.  Since a chinook is producing by Pacific air moving across the mountains, losing moisture and getting compressed warming the air up, I knew that I would experience a lot of snow as I drove West.  This was the day I hit the snow.  A snowfall warning was issued for this region, but fortunately there wasn't much traffic on the road except for a few semis.  Unfortunately,  the mountains are not visble at all due to the snow.  For comparison, you might wish to check out my video "Calgary to Vancouver - time lapse - part 3 of 5" which shows the same stretch of highway.    This video begins in Golden, BC which is where the Kicking Horse river flows into the Columbia river.  From Golden, the Trans-Canada highway follows the Columbia river on its Northbound course for a short while then climbs over the Selkirk range of mountains via the Rogers Pass (1330m elevation) and reaches Revelstoke, BC.    This range of mountains is known for getting a lot of snow in winter - around 10m per year.  The mountains in this area are also quite steep.  This combination leads frequent avalanches in the area.  Both the highway and the railway line are protected by avalanche sheds in stategic spots.        This was filmed on Feb. 4, 2011 at 20x real time.      The music used is Every Night, Every Day by Traffic.

Trip across Lake Huron on my Bayliner Avanti 3250 In the spring of 2008 I decided to make a short documentary of me and my 32' Bayliner crossing Lake Huron. The trip started in Sarnia and ended in Tobermory. I was single-handed and it was an adventurous thing to do. I made sure I always wore my PFD in case I fell overboard. The trip took 9 hours and $1500 in gas. It was well worth it for the bragging rights at my marina. ['Boat', 'trip', 'Lake', 'Huron', 'Great', 'lakes', 'Bayliner', 'Avanti', 'Adventure']
Pelion Mountain, Tantalus Range in Squamish BC, Ski Mountaineering Kevin and I had last minute plans to summit Pelion before we both had to leave for the summer, I've read trip reports of people skiing in and summiting within the day, or even doing the whole Tantalus traverse in a day! However, we wanted to take our time so we loaded up our enormous packs with plans to spend the night and summit early in the morning. Looking back it would have been a lot easier to take super light day packs and just go for it in a day.  Just under 200m from the summit we decided to turn around, the ski down was very icy but we still had a long enjoyable ski back to camp, and back to the river where we had to switch back to walking.  https://www.instagram.com/blake.mcintyre/ https://www.facebook.com/blakemcintyrephotography/ http://www.blakemcintyre.com/ ['skiing', 'back country', 'backcountry', 'mountaineering', 'ski mountaineering', 'tantalus', 'squamish', 'whistler', 'camping', 'adventure', 'hiking', 'trip', 'trip report', 'pelion', 'pelion mountain', 'ossa mountain', 'sigurd creek', 'sigurd peak', 'back country skiing']
Saskatoon to Chilliwack BC in under 10 minutes! ** Smart people read the description! **    I drove back to Chilliwack from Saskatoon so I could finish moving some of my stuff. Decided to take a time lapse video so you can see roughly how the drive from the Prairies to nearly the South Coast of BC is.     Couple of notes regarding what you will see here:    - I left Saskatoon at 4am local time. This was far too early. The first stop you see is me getting about 45 minutes of sleep in the parking lot of a KFC in Kindersley.  - I didn't account for rain when I first mounted my camera. It does rain briefly, but eventually does go away.  - For some reason, I lost about 45 minutes of pictures, so you will see a sudden "edit" in the middle. Don't think anything of significant value was really missed. :)  - The mount for my camera decided it didn't like where it was, so it fell down. I remounted it under my rear view mirror which seemed to work better - at least the wipers were now wiping the view of the camera.  - At the end as I near Chilliwack, the camera couldn't handle the direct sunlight, so the image gets a but wonky. Sorry bout that.. not much I can do.    Oh, and did I say camera? These pictures were taken on a Motorola Atrix 4G. 1024x768 resolution shot once every 4 seconds. Total drive time was 13.5 hours, including the sleep break in Kindersley and the time change back to PST just west of Golden, BC.

They feature winter sports held on snow or ice, such as Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, bobsledding and ice hockey. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been competed at every Winter Olympics since 1924. Other athletic events have been added  since.  Some of these events, such as luge, short track speed skating, and freestyle skiing have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program.  The first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France in 1924. Prior to this, figure skating and ice hockey had been events at the Summer Olympics.     Many countries have played home to the Winter Olympics. France has been host to the Games three times. The United States has hosted the Games four times, more than any other country. Several countries including Italy, Japan, Austria and Norway have hosted the Games twice.  Now in 2010, It is being held in Vancouver, British Columbia Canada. This will be the second time the Games will be held in Canada.The Games will then be hosted by Sochi, Russia in 2014. This will be the first time that Russia has hosted a Winter Olympic Games.

Waterway Tips #1 - Special Lock Fees? This is the first in a series of quick tips and insights when cruising on the Trent Severn Waterway.   This time, we answer the question of whether there are special, or additional fees to use the lift locks (located at Kirkfield and Peterborough) or the Big Chute Marine Railway.

French River Canoe Trip http://frontierbushcraft.com/expeditions/canoe-canada-french-river/ The Frontier Bushcraft French River canoeing expedition is an accessible, enjoyable and enabling Canadian canoe adventure trip. Here you can hone and integrate your bushcraft and expedition canoeing skills in a superb area of wild Ontario with a colossal canoe heritage, all under the guidance of experts in their field - Ray Goodwin and Paul Kirtley. This expedition provides fantastic opportunity to follow the paddles and portages of natives, explorers and voyageurs on a Canadian Heritage River.   The French River is one of the most important waterways in the history of Canada. A travel route of the Ojibwa Indians, the French River later became a key link in the fur trade. For this alone the French River would be remarkable. However, not only does the French River have an exceptional cultural history, it also possesses a rich natural diversity along with complex topography.  Located in south-central Ontario, the 110 km corridor of the French River drains the region of the Canadian Shield between Lake Nipissing in the east and Georgian Bay in the west. The French River flows through a landscape that remains largely as it was when the first Europeans explored it over three hundred years ago. The area provides great opportunities for employing canoe and bushcraft skills. Indeed, in this environment, they fit together perfectly.

Hammock Camping - 3 nights in Kawartha Highlands Here are the trip pictures: http://imgur.com/a/oLVaI  The lakes are Algonquin Provincial Park were still not iced-out by the end of may, so some friends and I went portaging at Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park (7 friends total). We started at Long Lake Lodge, where we rented canoes, and then headed west to Cox lake where we stayed for 3 nights.  I didn't go into my setup in the video, but here it is. I switched it up this time and went back to my first hammock - my Eno Doublenest with Whoopies. I used my HammockGear Burrow 40 (with 2oz overfill, all in the footbox), Warbonnet 3-Season Yeti, a Thermarest ZLite foam pad cut-to-size to cover the back of my legs and feet, and the Warbonnet Mambajamba. I'm 6'2'', so I need a decent sized pad to cover my legs since the torso-length UQ doesn't cover past my butt.  The only reason I brought 4 coffee crisp was to make all of the non-Canadians jealous - especially you, Shug :P  Hope you enjoy the video,  YellowRain  ----- This whole video was shot using the Samsung Galaxy S5 in (HDR Video with Smooth Motion 60fps).

Culture Shock Movie Part 3 by Saffron Hayes A documentary about travel experiences in India, Nepal and Alaska. Culture Shock, is a documentary about my personal experience while traveling from Juneau, Alaska to India and Nepal.  I am the project founder and artist, Saffron Hayes, and I started filming the documentary during the summer of 2004.  After finishing high school in Alaska, I­­­ traveled to southern India, Madras, and helped build an Ashram on the beach of a fishing village in Pondicherry.  After filming the beach and city life of southern India, I independently traveled north to Vanarsi city on the Ganges River, where the Indian people spiritually burn the dead in Ghats.  I decided to leave India to spend time with the mountain people of Nepal, where I documented their traditional way of life.  I trekked north, deeper into the Himalayan Mountains, until I reached Srinagar Kashmir and climbed 3,500 meters above sea level to see the alien terrain and razor peaks.  I trekked far away from urban life to experience the vast beauty of the Himalayan mountain landscape and document the cultural connection with the land.  The documentary follows the life of a young man growing up and traveling to the other side of the world and back. Going on this world adventure and documenting the culture differences, the audience will have a chance to see how different cultures deal with the psychological difficulties accompanied by a post-modern society.  This is an enormous project that has taken me eight years to get this far, but I want to share my life experiences with the world.

Snow Day! - First ATV Ride On The Lake This Year - Dec.16 2012 Finally the ice is thick enough so we went out for our first ride of the year on the lake with the Yamaha Grizzly and Kodiak. Also was our first real test ride wearing our Mustang Floater Suits. It was very reassuring to know that we had that extra protection in case we ever went through the ice. Hopefully, we will never have to find out how good they work! Thank you Mustang! http://www.mustangsurvival.com  As it turned out, we had a good dump of snow the day before, so we had that to play with also! But, we also had lots of shoveling and snow blowing to do when we got back:(  Also this was the first time we have come across a fellow Youtuber! We met up with "vishuscirquel" while we were stopped out on the ice road. If you like fishing, he has lots of great fishing videos from around the area. Be sure to check his videos out at: http://www.youtube.com/user/vishuscirquel  Tell him that Cubbee and CK sent you over!   If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe! An add to your featured "other channels box" would also be greatly appreciated.   Thanks for watching!

#678 A Day in the Canyons 1 CN Martel  2016-09-24 I had a very enjoyable day of looking for trains in the Thompson River Canyon and the Fraser River Canyon with Nick. We had some success.  Our first stop was not technically in the Thompson River Canyon, but close enough. CN Martel is just north of Spences Bridge at mile 68.4 of Canadian National's  Ashcroft Subdivision.  For the scoop on train numbers and locomotives, checkout https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV1b4LEYboM It's a good video with alternate views at the same locations by Nick (SD70ACEguy)   If you go to Google, select Maps and paste in  50.49390 -121.29410  you'll see the general location of this video.  Recorded with a Canon XA10 and a Sony HDR-CX110, . Edited and produced using Cyberlink PowerDirector 14 Ultra.   Information regarding locomotive types, build and other data are from the  '2015 Canadian Trackside Guide' published by (and available from) the Bytown Railway Society Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  N.B.The photographer and cameras did not encroach on the line of the right-of-way in taking this video. It is dangerous, foolhardy (and illegal) to enter on railway right-of-way. Just sayin' ...

But instead, he walked towards us and stopped in this little pool right across from our car. He had a good ol' drink and nosh and then crossed the road behind us and wandered off into a meadow.

Glorious Summer Boating Report From Fenelon Falls Another spectacular summer evening as we look at our mooring at the bottom of the Lock at Fenelon Falls, along the beautiful 240 mile long Trent Severn Waterway in Ontario, Canada.

Boat Cruise Bobcaygeon To Lakefield - Hot & Sunny Another very hot & sunny day for cruising on the water. Today we are heading along Ontario Canada's 240 mile long Trent Severn Waterway, heading from Bobcaygeon, across Pigeon Lake, through Buckhorn, Lovesick Lake, Stoney Lake and on to our stop for the next couple of days - the village of Lakefield on Lake Katchewanooka.   After a seven hour boat ride on this humid day, it sure was nice to jump in the water fro a refreshing swim. Afterward, a BBQ on the dock with my lovely Anchor Girl set us up for a gorgeous evening, watching the slowly setting sun over Lakefield Marina.   Awesome! As Mr. Bob Marley sings, this really does Satisfy My Soul.

Old Welland Canal The third Welland Canal took a more direct path from Port Dalhousie to Allanburg leaving behind the Twelve Mile Creek route. From Allanburg the canal continued to follow the previous path with the exception of bypassing many of the canal downtown community centers. Construction on the canal was completed in 1887. The third canal no longer depended on the feeder canal for its source of water. Instead water was directly supplied from lake Erie via the canal itself. The canal was now 4.3 meters deep and its 26 stone locks had swelled to a dimension of 13.7 meters in width with a distance of 82.3 meters between lock gates.

Bergeron Falls in the Winter - Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia Welcome to the Tumbler Ridge Global Geopark! At 100 m (328 ft), this is one of the highest known waterfalls in Northern British Columbia, and one of the closest to Tumbler Ridge. Set in a natural amphitheatre, water plunges off Bergeron Mountain and down into the Murray River Valley. You can hike in along a 4.5 km (2.8 mi) trail (one way) that climbs up and down along a series of ridges, finally depositing you at a viewpoint above the falls. For an ever-changing perspective, make your way back and forth along the edge of the bowl in which the falls are set.

Green Lake (Whistler) Green Lake is the largest and most northerly lake in the Resort Municipality of Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. It is the source of the Green River, a tributary of the Lillooet River, and is fed by the River of Golden Dreams, which issues from Alta Lake, which is at the height of land dividing the Green River drainage from that of the Cheakamus River to the south, which is a tributary of the Squamish River. Also feeding Green Lake are Fitzsimmons Creek, which originates in the valley above Whistler Village between Blackcomb and Whistler Mountains, and Rainbow Creek, which descends from Rainbow Mountain via the Alpine Meadows subdivision. A former minor ski hill, Rainbow , is located midway between Alpine Meadows and Emerald Estates near the lake's western extremity.  The Whistler neighbourhoods of Alpine Meadows and Emerald Estates are located on the lake's southwestern and northwestern shores, respectively. The ghost town of Parkhurst (aka Green River, though that is a rail stop at the outlet of Green Lake about 1km north), known locally but incorrectly as Soo Valley (the Soo Valley is nearby but in a different drainage), was based around a lumber mill on a point on the east shore of the lake at its narrowest point, opposite Emerald Estates; the porch of the old main building was the location of a locally famous group nude photo by squatter residents of the area in the 1970s, many of them now figures in the Whistler establishment.  Green Lake is 633 m in elevation and is approximately 1.2 km in length and averages about 650 m in width with an area in the range of 2.2 km².  Green Lake also serves as Whistler Airport (airport code YWS), a waterdrome.

PEYTO LAKE, Banff National Park, Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada Peyto Lake is located in Banff National Park near Bow Summit approximately 38Km north of Lake Louise on the Icefields Parkway.  The lake itself is easily accessed from the Icefields Parkway. It was named for Bill Peyto, an early trail guide and trapper in the Banff area.  Glacial lakes have that beautiful turquoise color due to fine grained glacial silt suspended in the water. The silt tends to refract the blue-green spectra of the sun's white light.

Northern Gannet, Cape Saint Mary's Ecological Reserve, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada Cape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve (known as "the Cape") is one of Newfoundland and Labrador's major seabird colonies. During the breeding season, it's home to a large colony of Northern gannets (approximately 24,000).     I've visited "the Cape" often with my still and/or my video camera, and what draws me back is the easy walking access to view these spectacular birds as close as ten meters away. Bird Rock is reached by a one-kilometer path, through grass and wildflower meadows that top steep cliffs.    Most of the gannet colony make their nests on "Bird Rock"— a tall sandstone stack that is separated from the viewing area by a chasm only a few meters wide. The gannets' courtship, nesting, and feeding behaviors are easily observed from the natural, cliff-top viewing area.    The visitor center is a much-needed addition to "the Cape". This footage was captured in July of 2008.

On the Coastal Trail of Pukaskwa National Park Dave and Deb of ThePlanetD hike the epic Pukaskwa Coastal Trail ---------- Subscribe for adventure! http://bitly.com/1NL1tD7  --------- The Pukaskwa Coastal Hike is one of the toughest hikes in Canada but also one of the most beautiful. Trekking along the coast of Lake Superior is a trip you will never forget. Outstanding views, tough challenges, beautiful scenery and an amazing time. We spent 7 days in Pukaskwa National Park and here are the highlights of our time camping and hiking along one of Canada's most famous and remote trails. Guiding by http://www.naturallysuperior.com  In partnership with http://www.ontariotravel.net http://outdoorontario.com  ThePlanetD Social Channels FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/ThePlanetD TWITTER: http://twitter.com/theplanetd INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/theplanetd THE BLOG: http://theplanetd.com/ Music by youtube audio library If you like our adventures why not share them with your friends or family For more adventures visit ThePlanetD.com http://theplanetd.com/ ------------- Video Transcript Woah, Nice Dave Take your Time,  We're good to go My favourite part of the Pukaskwa Hike, would have to be any of the coastal sections I think that was really, I can't really define it into one section, but I really enjoyed scrambling over the boulders, taking in those beautiful views of Lake Superior.  And also, the challenge of it as well, you know it's a challenge to sort of navigate all these slick boulders, with a pack on.  So the challenge, combined with the beautiful views, and the stunning landscape really made it the perfect thing for me.  Hiking the Pukaskwa Coastal Trail, here in Canada, is one of the top experiences of Trekking, that Dave and I have ever had.   It was really fun being with our guide Brenden. He really took care of us. He just made it easier and a lot more fun. He was always keeping us really occupied during the day, you could tell that he could feel when our energy was getting low.  So we'd start playing games with us, and stuff to keep our mind off of the pain in our feet.  And it was just a really good time to really see what you're made of and the challenges of being out there, not showering for 7 days, sleeping in the rain, and putting up your tent and carrying your pack.  It's really one of the toughest things that I've done but also the most rewarding.  And honestly, one of the best times I've had out in nature.  I don't know if this is foot therapy or foot torture.  Favourite part of the Pukaskwa Trail, would probably have to be each night when we'd get to camp, finish making dinner, cleaning everything up.  We'd have half an hour to an hour we were pretty early to bed.  Of just sitting there whether it was taking some pictures of the sunset, or just kind of relaxing, winding down for the night.  I really enjoyed that time with the exception of one night, every night was a beautiful evening.  That was definitely my favourite section.  I had a few favourite parts of the Pukaskwa Coastal Trail. I really enjoyed, walking inland through the forest, I loved the mossy section, I loved the trails, but I also really loved going on the coastal trail and being really high on the cliffs, and overlooking Lake Superior.  It was pretty spectacular.  Yeah Well, we had to sign into the guest book that we were here.  Dave, Deb and Brenden, Ontario Canada. North Swallow out to Haddie Cove.  We made it, we did it!  So if you get a chance to hike the Pukaskwa Trail here in Ontario Canada, do it! Might be a bit of a rough boat ride today.

#626 ThrowBack Thursday CN Kitsumkalum 1976  2015-11- 26 I've been posting an occasional ThrowBack Thursday photo to a Facebook page to which I belong. This time I'm throwing in a short video. The quality is terrible, as the original video (and camera) were also terrible. When I got this film back from the developer (in 1976) I realised I was wasting my money on film!  The subject is following a short Extra movement to get ballast from the KitsumKalum Pit, west of Terrace, BC. The caboose is necessary because the move is beyond the yard limits at Terrace.  If you go to Google, select Maps and paste in 54.52995 -128.65980 you'll see the exact location of this video.  Recorded with a Bell and Howell 8mm film camera of dubious heritage.

August 2014 Canoe Trip to Harcus Strachan Lake Six of us headed out on a wilderness paddling trip in northern Manitoba to commemorate Harcus Strachan, a veteran of WWI and WWII. Strachan was the only member of the Fort Garry Horse to receive a Victoria Cross. A lake in Manitoba has been named after him. We built a cairn and placed an engraved aluminum plaque in his honour on the shore of the newly named Strachan Lake.  #howiremember ['#howiremember', 'Victroria Cross', 'Victoria Cross (Award Category)', 'VC', 'Fort Garry', 'Fort Garry Horse', 'Canadian', 'Military', 'Canadian Military', 'Canoe', 'Canoe trip', 'Memorial', 'Canada']

Port Huron Float Down 2014 - REAL USA Ep. 112 reloaded The Port Huron Float Down has been happening every third Sunday in August on the St. Clair River in Port Huron, Michigan for decades! Some claim it started in the 1970's and others say it began back in the 1960's. Whatever the case, it has taken on a life of its own from the days when a few people got together and floated down the river before summer came to an end. Today the Port Huron Float Down is a huge event that attracts somewhere on the order of 100,000 visitors to the city both as participants and spectators. Even our Canadian neighbors in Sarnia, Ontario came out to watch the vast parade of people willing to brave the cold water and rapid current.

They're not just trimmed and organized clips, hes got some serious editing skills so check it out! Cole's a real Manitoba skater with the sponsors to prove it, and the mindset to succeed.

Kitsault BC **Please Feel Free to Share**  A quick tour through Kitsault BC. Sorry it's a little shaky. Caretakers take care of the place, mow lawns, etc. There was underground electrical, apartment buildings, everything a town had. It still has. When I come to the end, all those foundations were houses that were airlifted out. The "Manager's House" was the driveway we pulled into.. Imagine waking up to that view..wow..  Kitsault is an abandoned town in Northern British Columbia, Canada. Owned by a single person, it has been closed to the public for years, for more information, please check out: http://www.kitsault.com/about_hist.html for history ['Kitsault', 'Ghost town', 'Molybdenum Mine', 'Heaven on Earth', 'Peaceful', 'Mining (Industry)', 'canada', 'housing', 'Industry', 'wildlife', 'ocean', 'Town', 'Sky', 'Blue', 'Clouds', 'Nature', 'Sun', 'Relax', 'british columbia', 'tours', 'travel', 'mountains', 'alice arm', 'Adventure', 'Culture', 'bears', 'millionare', 'cranberry connector', 'dirt road', 'Sunset', 'Destination', 'helicopter', 'Fly', 'Relaxing', 'Events', 'Tourism', 'Museum', 'Landmark', 'Sunrise', 'august']

On the Onakawana & Moose Rivers 1978 By rail and canoe to tidewater at Moosonee.  A 1978 journey from Cochrane to Otter Rapids on the Abitibi River, a portage through the forest the Onakawna River, and then downstream towards the Abitibi. There were so many meanders, beaver dams, walks and fallen trees on the Onakawana that time ran out.  The train was picked up close to the Abitibi confluence and taken as far as the wide, open and relatively insect free Moose River.  There were no scheduled stations between Cochrane and Moosonee, so you just flag down the train.

Road Trip to Killaloe (002) Julie and I drive from our home in London, Ontario to Killaloe to visit her family at their cottage on the Bonnechere River near Golden Lake. We make stops at Canon in Toronto, as well as Peterborough, and the famous Wilno Tavern.  Thanks for watching, please like, comment, & subscribe.   Follow me: Twitter: https://twitter.com/GeraldUndone Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/GeraldUndone/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GeraldUndone/   Gear I used to make this video: My Camera: http://amzn.to/2efaFBU My Lens: http://amzn.to/2effPxK My Studio Mic: http://amzn.to/2efaNRW My Run & Gun Video Mic: http://amzn.to/2ddvalA Tripod: http://amzn.to/2fx2xmn Head: http://amzn.to/2fjijfB Audio Interface: http://amzn.to/2fwXGla Headphones: http://amzn.to/2fjghMG   Synopsis:  The video opens on a packing montage as Julie and Gerald prepare for their weekend in Killaloe.   Their first stop is at Canon in Mississauga to repair the focusing screen on the 5D Mark III.  After hitting traffic in Toronto, they eventually make it to Peterborough where they visit Julie’s friend, Sarah.  The next stop is in Wilno to get some food. They eat the famous perogies of the Wilno Tavern, before going to the lookout.  They make a pit stop in Killaloe to drop some stuff off at Julie’s parent’s house then head to the cottage on Bonnechere River.  The rest of the night is spent setting up the tent, avoiding mosquitos, and applying AfterBite.  The weekend is then spent boating on the river, swimming, exploring the woods, photographing wildlife, and spending time with family.  On Sunday, a flash rain storm ruined their tent packing plans, and forced Julie and Gerald to dry out all their gear.  They eventually got back on the road for the long journey home.   About Me:  Hi! I’m Gerald. Welcome to my channel. Thanks for taking the time to watch this video. I have many other videos on my channel that range in content, including: comedy sketches, gaming videos, DIYs with a unique twist, funny unboxings, passionate reviews, gear talk, rants, life hacks, and even my attempt at an artistic vlog.   I am from London, Ontario, Canada, and have lived in that area most of my life, including West Lorne where I grew up, and a brief stay in Toronto.  I’ve always been passionate about video and filmmaking. When I was younger I was fascinated with my father’s video cameras. He was big into electronics and loved to make home movies, so he was always fussing around with the latest and greatest in consumer camera equipment. I used every excuse I could in school to make my class assignments into videos to allow me to break out the camera and show off my quirky sense of humour. Sadly, after high school, I hung up my amateur filmmaker hat and switched to writing. I’ve been a semi-professional writer and blogger for nearly 10 years and have had several successes.  In 2013, I started running a photography business with my fiancée, Julie. We started out as sports photographers, but now Julie Whelan Photography has moved into active lifestyle and outdoor adventure photography, while not completely abandoning the action sports side. This has given me the resources, gear, and inspiration to finally give YouTube a try.   I hope that my passion for filmmaking, my skills as a writer, and my experience with photography will allow me to create some unique, innovative, and entertaining videos for the YouTube community. So, please subscribe to my channel, and let’s give this a shot together.   Why Undone?  The idea behind the ‘Undone’ part of Gerald Undone is simple. I just entered into my 30s when I started this channel and had been noticing that as I got older I started to take things way more seriously than I ever did before. As a kid I was the class clown type, constantly looking to entertain. As I aged, I found less and less time for silliness and fun. As with most things, it’s easier to notice faults in others than it is in yourself, and it wasn’t until I started to get annoyed at how seriously my peers (now also in their 30s) were taking life that I wanted to change.   The second component is my lifelong problem of feeling like I don’t quite fit in. I often don’t understand the motivations of my peers, and save for my close friends, I don’t think that my peers comprehend mine. As I got older, this divide grew instead of shrank, and I found myself faking it most of the time to try and relate.  So, ‘Undone’ suggests that the pressures of trying to fit into society have been slowly pulling the thread on this serious persona I’ve created for myself. That the years of faking it have finally pulled this façade apart. Now I’ve returned to my most honest, goofy, and albeit borderline insane by conventional standards self. The unfunny, serious, adult me has come unfastened. I have come undone.

Sea To Sky Gondola In Squamish, BC! Easy hikes, great view. Hey everyone!  Part 2 of my birthday celebration I head to the Sea to Sky Gondola in Squamish, BC. The weather was gorgeous and the crowd wasn't too big, but I wouldn't count on having the same luck during full on summer months!   It costs $37.95 for an adult ticket, and although I do find it a little pricey, it's been a long time since I've gotten in touch with nature and the short hikes with gorgeous views for little effort was up my alley.   The Sky Pilot Suspension Bridge was also super fun to walk, just a little rocky to give me the sense of danger I'm looking for.

Campground Flooding in BC, Canada The RV Park we've been staying in is directly on the Harrison River in the Fraser Valley of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Over the past couple of weeks, the water in the Harrison & Fraser Rivers has risen to its highest level in 40 years and many area campgrounds are partially or completely submerged.  There have been floods like this before, but not for quite some time.  We drove to several campgrounds today, including Matsqui Trail Regional Park on the Fraser River in the metro Vancouver region between Abbotsford & Mission, and Kilby Park campground at the Kilby Historic site in Harrison Mills. We also paddled our canoe through the parking lot of our own park, also in Harrison Mills.  We tried to visit one other nearby park, but all the RVs have been evacuated and the gate is locked.  There are reports of flooding in many parts of the BC Lower Mainland, including here in the Fraser Valley.  Chilliwack and other areas are affected by the Fraser River, and we're of course affected by the flooding on the Harrison River.  Luckily for us, our RV park is on a hill and we're at the top of it.  Only the very lowest-lying sites have been directly affected, where you can canoe from the Harrison River right up the boat ramp and into the parking lot, which we did.  We're hoping for fewer rainy days and abating of flood waters soon.  Lower temperatures would help as well, slowing the snowmelt in the surrounding Coast Mountains.

While we're not RV technicians, we're very mechanically inclined and have learned a lot about RV systems over the years. We've handled most of our own minor service, maintenance and upgrade work on both of our RVs.  We meet lots of newer RVers who are eager to learn some basics about using, maintaining and caring for their rigs. After more than a decade on the road, we're happy to share what we've learned (some of it the hard way). ;-)  We hope our experience can help other RVers go DIY, saving time & money while experiencing the satisfaction of a job well done. We're handy RVers, not professional technicians. We're happy with the techniques and products we use, but be sure to confirm that all methods and materials you use are compatible with your equipment and abilities. Regardless of what we recommend, consult a professional if you're unsure about working on your RV. Any task you perform or product you purchase based on any information we provide is strictly at your own risk.

Laying Low in Logan Lake, British Columbia, Canada I am just laying low at the municipal Logan Lake campground with my 30 amp connection and my free OTA cable TV chilling with Sammie the Pooper....  Decided to come up here on Labor Day to avoid the traffic madness of everyone else up here over the long weekend.  Us retired unemployed folks can do that! LOL.  I am just enjoying the quiet shoulder tourist season here in western Canada in the RV. Travel where I want and when I want. I feel like Nomadic Fanatic with a passport and a pension!  Logan Lake will be my future summer home.  It is a slice of my personal heaven up here.  In the meantime, stay safe folks and Keep Your Wheels on the Ground!

Magnificent Canadian Rocky Mountains near Banff, Alberta, Canada Magnificent Canadian Rocky Mountains near Banff, Alberta, Canada.  Join us on a soothing photographic slide show journey through the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Alberta and British Columbia, Canada in May, 2001.  We will start just outside of Calgary at the Olympic Village, home of the 1988 Winter Olympics and then travel into Banff National Park to see Lake Louise.  We were surprised to see the emerald blue/green lake was still locked in winters grip.  Do you see our reflections in the reflecting ball?    In Banff we stopped to take pictures at the Banff National Park administration building and the Banff Springs Hotel.  A seven minute ride on the gondola took us to the top of Sulphur Mountain for the most spectacular views and photo opportunities in Banff National Park.  Back off the mountain we toured the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, the birthplace of Canada's National Park system, which began here in 1885.   As we travelled north on the Ice Fields Parkway we drove past Bow Lake and the Num-Ti-Jah Lodge stopping for the evening at the Glacier View Inn.  Our corner room overlooked the glacier and the beautiful late winter surroundings. The next day we were off to the Athabasca Glacier on a snow coach tour to the upper reaches of the glacier just below the Columbia Ice Field.  These coaches were made specifically for this glacier.  As a matter of fact, the diesel engines in the snow coaches are the same model that powers generators for the Glacier View Inn since power lines have not reached this remote stretch of the park, if ever!   As the glaciers melt, their waters cut their way to the oceans creating dynamic scenery such as Athabasca Falls. The water is laden with fine powder called rock flour and the water carries this milky, abrasive substance downstream into lakes creating stunning beauty such Emerald Lake where we took a leisurely canoe ride.

Watertown Lakes - The Campers Waterton Lakes National Park is a national park located in the southwest corner of Alberta, Canada, and borders Glacier National Park in Montana, USA. The park contains 505 km2 (195 sq mi) of rugged mountains and wilderness.  The Crypt Lake Trail is one of the premium hikes in Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada. It is accessed by a dedicated ferry service operating from the Waterton Park Townsite.  The cascading Crypt Falls are over 150 metres (490 ft) high and are fed by Crypt Lake in the hanging valley above the falls. The last part of the trail is the ascent to Crypt Lake. This part is more challenging; in parts the walk runs at the edge of steep drops, secured by cable and also involves crawling through a narrow, but short, tunnel. Finally the trail reaches the shores of Crypt Lake through a small forest.   This video could not be made without the amazing friends Maksym Ovchinnikov and Pavel Skyba  This AWESOME soundtrack was created by my amazing friend Serge Gamache. Hopefully soon will be available for download.    Film and Edited by Lucas Mendonca using a GoPro Hero 3+ Black, on a bike mount and a Sony NEX 5N ( which broke during our hike)   Edited using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6  Make sure to follow me on Facebook and don't forget to subscribe on our page.

Craziest Adventure Trip of Desi Boys to The Killarney Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada!!! A trip by 5 Desi Buddies to Canadian Provincial Park (The Killarney).  So far this was the best Provincial Park we ever have been to, With no restrictions and full privacy. All the camping sites were with enough distance which was best for the friends like us who went to enjoy late night party with campfire and beer :) George lake was very near by to our campsite which was so amazing. We did cliff jumping, canoy sailing, And Hiking to "the Crack" trail was the most amazing part(One advice don't give up on halfway to trail, The view from the top is worth hiking a long trail). Staff at the park was, so friendly they didn't bother while we were talking and enjoying outside till early morning.I would love to visit this park again and again. I would say this 2 days at Killarney was way better than camping grounds at Tobermory with half price and they don't even charge for person more than 2. I would highly recommend this park just go for it guys you will surely have great time as we had cheers :).

Killarney, Bell-David Lake Loop, October/2011 Day#1   Departed Bell Lake access October 3, 2011. Paddled into strong headwinds north through Bell and 3 Mile Lakes to 30 m portage ( lift over ) into Balsam Lake staying on this lake at Campsite 113 this was a nice clean campsite  Day#2   Broke camp after breakfast,we were on the water by 10:30am. Paddled through Balsam Lake to the 645 m portage (Gruelling for 1st 200 m very steep) into David Lake. A spectacular view of Silver Peak awaits you at the end of this portage. From here we paddled around David Lake to look for available sites we discovered we were the only people on the lake ( later we seen the group of seven we had seen yesterday in balsam they set up on 121 on the other end of the lake). After looking most of the sites we chose 106, 40 m strait up hill the view was fantastic. About 2am we awoke for bladder relief, on the way back to the tent I looked down the ridge with my headlamp only to have 2 very round eyes looking back about 40 m away halfway down the ridge. The wife was back at the tent and asked if we could get in yet I hollered "NO". Then the Eyes slowly turned away and it was dark.Knowing our barrel was hung safely and our camp food free.We got back in the tent went to sleep.   Day#3   Awaking at 8:00am I did not mention the bear to Heather until morning she said she would not have been  able to sleep had I told her earlier. This day being our layover we had our breakfast, pumped water, packed lunch in a day pack, cleaned up, and hung the food barrel getting on the water at 10:30am. We then paddled to the Boundary Lake portage to start our hike to Silver Peak after stashing our canoe we headed up the trail in full fall colours to Boundary Lake to where it crosses the LaCloche Silhouette trail. Here we followed the blue markers until we came out heading up a white quartz ridge where there were cairns (piles of rocks) that are used for navigation on the trail. From here you could see almost all of Boundary Lake the colours and Beauty are indescribable and have to be seen even pictures can't do justice. As we were reaching the top there was a great big black bear standing 40 m away right beside the cairn marking the trail at the top of the ridge, looking right at us. I took one quick picture while telling my wife that there was a bear right there then raised my hiking poles up in the air and with one loud "HEY BEAR" it turned and walk off the top of the ridge towards Boundary Lake. With luck having us going the opposite way once we reached the top. When we did reach the top the bear was feeding150 m down the ridge I took 30 seconds of video and a few quick pics spending any more time near the bear than necessary would be foolish. So we continued down the LaCloche Silhouette trail again towards Silver Peak trail with a keen eye on our back. The trail heads down from here to end of Boundary Lake then hooks up with the Silver Peak trail from hear 2 km up hill brutal to say the least, hiking boots are essential . While reaching the top is a satisfying experience on its own the view that awaits you is simply breathtaking. After a much needed rest, lunch, and many photos we headed back down to our canoe then paddled back to camp without seeing the bear again. With supper cooked and the barrel hung an hour before dark, we set out looking for firewood enough for that nights fire and some extra as is customary for the next  weary souls who pass this way. Had a fire then headed to bed tired from the 8 km round trip hike and had an uneventful night (no bears).   Day#4   We woke at daybreak it was cold so we rolled up the sleeping gear, tent, clothes, and camp shoes  packing it all in the Sealine pack this kept us warm. We then had breakfast, cleaned up, and packed the rest in the pantry barrel then loaded our canoe hitting the water by10:30am. From camp 106 we paddle all the way across David Lake to the 200 m portage into David Creek. This was an easy portage we had a snack break after completing portage. Then paddled through David Creek, which was beautiful with all fall colours along the white quartz ridges of Silver peak. After a short paddle we arrived at the 775 m portage back to Bell Lake. This portage was relatively strait forward but looked like it could be a bitch in wet weather. We completed the portage then headed into Bell Lake stopping to use the thunder box on site 74 we then ate lunch reflecting on our travels and experiences  while looking at Silver Peak. With mixed emotions we headed for the Bell Lake access, on one hand we were really going to miss all this tranquility and on the other hand our tired old bodies begged for a soft bed.    The weather on this trip was simply gorgeous, with the exception of a couple of stiff headwinds we could not have asked for better trip with only one other group on David and Balsam Lakes it had the feeling of remoteness not often found in this park.

Rocky Mountains (Canadian Rockies) North America Canada video HD The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 3,000 miles (4,800 km) from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  The Rocky Mountains were initially formed from 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny, in which a number of plates began to slide underneath the North American plate. The angle of subduction was shallow, resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America. Since then, further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys. At the end of the last ice age, humans started to inhabit the mountain range. After Europeans, such as Sir Alexander Mackenzie, and Americans, such as the Lewis and Clark expedition, started to explore the range, minerals and furs drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never became densely populated.  The Canadian Rockies (French: Rocheuses canadiennes) comprise the Canadian segment of the North American Rocky Mountains. They are the eastern part of the Canadian Cordillera, which is a system of multiple ranges of mountains which runs from the Canadian Prairies to the Pacific Coast. The Canadian Rockies mountain system comprises the southeastern part of this system, laying between the Interior Plains of Alberta and Northeastern British Columbia on the east to the Rocky Mountain Trench of BC on the west. The southern end borders Idaho and Montana of the USA. In geographic terms the boundary is at the Canada/US border, but in geological terms it might be considered to be at Marias Pass in northern Montana. The northern end is at the Liard River in northern British Columbia. --------------------- Thank you for watching! Please Like, Comment, Subscribe and Share with your friend!

Winter in Kin Coulee Park, Medicine Hat Since I had to work Christmas, my wife and I were unable to be down in Medicine Hat till the week after the holidays.

Helicopter to Mt. Assiniboine Naiset Hut, hiking the Rocky Mountains We flew by helicopter into and out of the Mt. Assiniboine Lodge at the beginning of July, 2014. Located high in the Rocky Mountains near the B.C. Alberta border, melting snow fed rushing streams and waterfalls. The scenery was stunningly beautiful. We stayed in the rustic Naiseth Huts and ate our meals in the well equipped and clean kitchen building. There are lots of hiking options, across wide meadows and up to lookouts above the treeline. We didn't see any bears, but there were signs that they had been there last year. We didn't, but you can hike in and out, camp in tents, or stay in the lodge and have your meals prepared.

Spring Thaw on the Current River The goal was to hike along the Current River, view the spring thaw, and reach the remains of the dam that once held Onion Lake.

Victoria BC Johnson Street Bridge Demolition A victim of neglect; the beginning of the end for our iconic blue bridge.  In 2011 the City of Victoria,British Columbia, Canada decided to replace the 87 year old Johnson street blue bridge.  The structure, designed in 1920 and completed in 1924, is one of the few remaining JosephStrauss designed bascule bridges left in North America. Of particular note are the two adjacent bascule spans carrying road and rail traffic respectively.  Joseph Strauss later went on to design San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge.  On Friday February 24th 2012, demolition of the blue bridge began with the removal of the rail bascule;  perhaps severing forever, Victoria's historic rail link to the rest of Vancouver Island.  City council chose not to include a rail component in the new design.  The city of Victoria publishes their Johnson street bridge info. here: http://www.johnsonstreetbridge.com  The project is not without controversy and other information is available at: http://johnsonstreetbridge.org/  and... http://focusonline.ca/?q=search/node/johnson%20street%20bridge amongst others...  History buffs, have a look here: http://www.hallmarksociety.ca/Harbeck/59.htm  ....and don't forget Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Street_Bridge  etc., etc.  This short video marks  the beginning of the end for our iconic blue bridge.  If only there had been a proper maintenance plan in place through the years.... Controversy aside, the start of demolition was spectacular....and yes it was raining hard that day!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE. April 2012. Read David Broadland's analysis in Victoria's Focus magazine... http://focusonline.ca/?q=node/357 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE. April 2012. by Patrick Murphy, a letter writer to Victoria's Focus magazine... http://focusonline.ca/?q=node/366  "Smoke and mirrors at City Hall  For those who have not watched a sheep-herding demonstration, I commend to you a Victoria City Council committee of the hopeless I snoozed through recently.  In March this flock met to hear from its highly-paid ring knockers about why the new Blue Bridge is going to cost 20 percent more for now and probably double before it is never built. For hours these so-called professionals droned on and the dutiful flock did not even ask the traditional "How high?" when staff told them to jump. The issue was why the price had gone up so dramatically over what voters had been promised in a referendum. A full report was presented two days prior to the meeting, but since our councillors are not bright enough to read it, the gang of engineers read it to them, and, oh what a song and dance it was.  Why, they have to pay more for insurance on construction. There would be more millions for archaeological costs. Who would have thunk you would have to get insurance on a project? And what a surprise to discover First Nations had lived there. I wonder if they lived anywhere else in the province?  The presentation was mind-boggling. One consultant gave a Power Point show of bridge designs and noted they were in 3D. One of several thousand examples given of bridges that may or may not be built was in Ireland with a prison in the background where "Irish independents" were kept, so this showed what a bridge could do. Was this a sales pitch for a new bridge or an explanation of why costs had gone through the roof? One thing made clear was that all these bridges were "iconic." Then there was the startling revelation that the seabed was irregular. Apparently, it started high and went down. Guess no previous bridge builder here had discovered that.  All this was in the report, but none of the sheep said "Get on with it. We know your smoke and mirrors: Why has the bill gone up?"  Great blather was made of the fact the whole project had been peer reviewed. Who were these peers—the Smurfs?  No one suggested the staff overseeing this should be fired. No one suggested the engineers be fired and it was time to cut losses and re-evaluate with someone who knew what they were doing.  No, it was the old saw of "We have spent this much already, so we might as well carry on."  So when a new bridge does open—maybe—in 12 years, the cost will be closer to $200 million. Who would have thought the province was so wise in keeping out of this farce?

Part 2  Algonquin Park, Tim Lake Solo Camping 2013 This is Part 2 of my Tim Lake Camping Video Blog.. Lots of Loons, nice views..  Tim Lake is a easy paddle into Algonquin, except when the wind is blowing hard. My trip out at the end consisted of battling a 15-20k wind all the way back to the parking lot. There are 6 campsites on the lake, most of them not particularly good for children. Sharp drop offs into deep water, and lots of kiddie loving leaches. Once you find a good place to camp with children, you have to train children to camp in the woods. Among other things, you should inform them that BEARS love little children. If their nice and quiet, the BEARS will not know they are even there. But, once they start yelling, screaming, crying, the BEARS will know Exactly where they are and come looking for them..........At Night..........In The Dark...(''')-.-(''')     So, If your camping the interior of Algonquin, please keep your children quiet for every ones sake. Particularly theirs! The BEARS, and other campers will appreciate it! You might even get to see some other wildlife....They appreciate quiet too... :=) ['Algonquin', 'Solo', 'Camping', 'Loons', 'Bears', 'Children', 'Noise', 'peace and quiet', 'Tim Lake', 'Tim River', 'Island']

Voices of Bute Inlet (part 1 of 2) Bute Inlet is on the front line for corporate greenwash and environmental devastation.  This wilderness is threatened by a mammoth industrial power project under the guise of "green power".  Private companies are running amok in BC, staking claim to creeks and rivers for private power generation.  Bute inlet, known as BC's Himalayas, has been staked by Plutonic Power and General Electric for a proposed 1,000 Megawatt project which would put 17 rivers into pipes.  Home to the last sustainable population of grizzly bears on the coast, "supernatural BC" stands to lose a gem of it's crown, and public control of it's power assets...

Survival heating tool "FIREWAALL-003" made in Canada Design by SPORTES inc. Copyright 2016  100% made in Canada Pre order on our web site www.sportesoutdoortools@gmail.com  ''FIREWAAL with two ''A'' 'because we burn wood Better outdoors''      The FIREWAALL-003 is an outdoor heating wood-burning tool for one to two people camping or surviving in nature. Compact and movable, it plays the role of raised rack + wood distributor and heat reflector to the fireplace.  • 100% made in Canada • 3/32 "thick laser cut / folded Stainless steel 304L  • 4,5 Lb  • Width 13 inches x 13,25 inches High • Four main components:  1 perforated base plate / combustion chamber 1 separator / wood rack 2 structural legs and dividers / wood rack  HISTORY  We observed that some extreme campers (Bushcrafters) erected a wooden wall stacked horizontally behind their campfire to reflect the heat towards them. This method, apparently inspired by the sheet metal or the bricks at the back of the stoves and internal fireplaces, seemed laborious to implement. Problems such as the significant upwards heat loss upward (usual on a campfire to the ground) added to the complexity and time of erecting a 'wall' behind the fire made no sense.  FEATURES  • No tools required • NO contact between floor and fire • Oppportunity to make fire in any outdoor environment and conditions • Self-feeding wood log supply by gravity • Optimization of energy efficiency by reflecting heat and light • Orientability of the fire depending on wind direction  • Optimization of the oxygen supply during combustion • Mobility of the fire rack   The efficiency of combustion and the fluidity of gravity feeding of wood is extremely efficient and requires little effort. Unlike a traditional fireplace open to the ground, the user does not have to blow the fireplace and go all around the pitt to push the burnt wood down to the center so the fire does not go out .   The FIREWAALL-003 has been designed to provide:  • More heat • More light • More combustion • Less handling   CREDITS:  Host :         Cedric Sportes / founder SPORTES inc Direction :  Christophe Terrade Editing :      Maxime Dumont  Music:        GOODMAN by Futuro Pelo (benjamin sportes)   Copyright 2016.

Part 1, Algonquin Park, Tim Lake Solo Camping August 2013 This is my first time back to Tim Lake in Algonquin Park in 8 years. I spent 6 nights from Sunday August 4th to Saturday August 10th. I usually camp at the same spot on this lake every time I'm in here. Over the years I've Probably spent 200 nights on the island. This is a video blog of this trip. I usually set up a base camp, and go out every day from there. I've been Solo camping in Algonquin since 1985. Took 8 years off because my Kids said I was getting too old to spend that much time alone in the woods, so I bought a bigger Canoe (Ebbtide Cruiser, sleeps 4, 27 feet long). But that type of boating was not for me so I sold it, and I'm back in the park every summer until I'm 'really' too old to do this any more.. Don't forget to watch part two, it's shorter, but more loon calls, and the windy paddle back. ['Solo Campming', 'Algonquin', 'Tim Lake', 'Tim River', 'Canoe', 'Solo', 'Loons', 'Island', 'Too Old']

Ren Neo and Leo at Whistler Optimist Sailing Camp  july 2011 The boys sailed for 5 days at Whistler Sailing association on Alta lake in Whistler. The class photo was doodled on by Leo I was going to blur there faces out for privacy concerns but he said he had a better idea . It was Rens 13th birthday and I got him a water proof video camera so the beginning footage is quite dodgy as they have never used is before.  Ren really excelled at this sport I think there is so much the same as riding hands motion balance core strength and so on . His coach said Ren is in the top 3 of the fastest learners he has ever seen in sailing . after 5 days Ren is onto his White sail 3 and will be training for some races.. He is so stoked !!!!!!!!!  Neo was using the camera the most as his weight was so little it made the boat handling quiet hard for him .  At 6:18 Rens coach starts filming a little run with Ren he looks pretty good for the little time he has been on the water sailing He almost capsizes once but does a quiet recovery .   At the end of the Video is Zen being the center of attraction and his sailing class sings happy birthday ['Opti', 'sailing', 'Whistler', 'club', 'Optimist', 'sa', 'boat', 'saling', 'kids', 'fresh', 'water', 'white', 'sail', 'lessons', 'water sports', 'ocean', 'july', 'camp', 'whistler', 'association', 'whistlersailing', 'whistler sailing']

Amazing dolphin stampede in Gwaii Haanas! Cute, playful and smart - what more can you ask for in a travel companion?  Parks Canada staff in Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, National Marine Conservation Area Reserve and Haida Heritage Site were lucky enough to capture this amazing springtime dolphin stampede on camera.  Pacific white-sided dolphins are extremely active, and sometimes approach boats to "bow ride" the pressure waves created by their bows. They are usually sighted in pods of 10-100 animals, although super groups of up to 2000 have also been seen.  Please consult our guidelines for marine mammal watching and bow riding safety information: http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/bc/gwaiihaanas/activ/activ5.aspx  Videographer: Clint Johnson-Kendrick  Connect with Gwaii Haanas on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GwaiiHaanas  Cette vidéo est aussi disponible en français à https://youtu.be/kk6MReNr6Fg ['Dolphin', 'boat', 'wildlife', 'animal', 'marine', 'amazing', 'cute', 'fun', 'ocean', 'sea', 'stampede', 'bow riding', 'awesome', 'incredible', 'nature', 'Gwaii Haanas', 'Haida Gwaii', 'wild', 'animals', 'Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve And Haida Heritage Site (Protected Site)', 'Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve', 'Cool', 'Cruise', 'Sailing', 'Crazy']

Princess Louisa Inlet - British Columbia (trailer) Princess Louisa Inlet is a remote place on the west coast of British Columbia, is a mere gap of six kilometres long and just a few hundred meters wide and may possibly be be one of the most beautiful places on earth. It can only be reached by boat or float plane at the tip of the long body of water called Jervis Inlet.In 1919 a young man named James MacDonald discovered, fell in love and filed for ownership of the lands  surrounding the inlet, with Chatterbox Falls at it's head. In 1953 MacDonald transferred ownership of these land to the Princess Louisa International Society.  The sheer cliffs rise a mile high, straight from the water. All around is the thick rainforest; the trees are tall and their trunks are covered with greeny/blue moss. The forest glades are deeply shaded and one half expects gnomes, elves and fairies to arrear from around the trees. The tweeting and chattering of the birds are constant. It is a truly magical place, restful and tranquil. Everyone should be fortunate enough to see Princess Louisa Inlet, the Princess as MacDonald referred to it, at least once in their lives.

Sailboat Ran Aground at White Rock Pier After a regatta a skipper unfamiliar with the very narrow channel at the White Rock Pier in BC went too wide and ran aground with 5 people on board.  No one was injured, and the sailboat wasn't damaged, but it was an ebb tide, which meant the water lever was dropping and would strand the boat even further as the tide went out.  The challenge was to free the sailboat from the sand ledge as soon as possible before it rolled on its side and took on water.  The LYMC.ca - Lower Mainland Yacht Club moors their fleet at this pier and a number of its members and experienced sailors were on hand working to tow the grounded sailboat free. Some of them had raced in the regatta that day.  Easy fixes were tried first, like rocking the grounded sailboat and pulling it by hand with lines from the dock, but the keel was wedged in the sand too tight.  A second plan to use a catamaran called "BAD KITTY" and to use a winch on "Lightcure" were quickly put in place.  Bad Kitty attached a tow line to the halyard of the grounded sailboat with the intent of pulling the top of the mast over freeing the keel from the sand, while simultaneously a line was attached to the starboard winch of Lightcure that would pull the bow of the grounded boat forward.  While the grounded sailboat was being towed from both points, it gunned its engine to assist in being freed.  It was an interesting exercise demonstrating why speed and teamwork are critical in rescue operations.  This is a good example for training purposes, but keep in mind all situations are different and this might not be the right or safe solution for you.

Sailing Bute Inlet, B.C. Slideshow This is a 35 mile solo cruise up Bute Inlet (British Columbia) to Waddington Harbor at it's head July 9-10, 2015.  The inlet is long, wide, and uniformly very deep without any recommended or desirable anchorages along the way.  I experienced no advantage going up with the tide and winds were lite.  My single night at Waddington Harbor was peaceful as not another soul was there as well as no AM, FM, VHF radio, and very poor reception on SSB.  The return trip was against the tide and 25-28K winds gusting to 34K resulting in speed as low as 2.4K; turning around was not an option for fear of losing the rubber dinghy.  It was an almost 12 hour duty day at the helm to a suitable anchorage outside Bute at Von Donop Inlet.  Photos were taken with a Sony Bloggie MHS-TS20.

BEAVER - Species at Risk Wilderness Committee British Columbia BEAVER. Cindy and I feel honored by this e-mail.  Hello,  I am the Species at Risk Outreach Coordinator for the Wilderness  Committee, working on a public campaign to support endangered species  legislation in BC. We have 1,600 species at risk in the province, and  BC is one of only two provinces in Canada with no legislation to  protect our wildlife.  I am looking for footage to include on our website (http://www.lastplaceonearth.ca/  ) and to promote our campaign. I believe you have fantastic footage of  wildlife species in BC, and I am wondering if you would let us use  your work for promoting this important campaign. We will give you  credit of course. Please let me know what you have and if you could  send me some links to your work.  Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Joffre Lakes Provincial Park Hike to Matier Glacier Joffre Lakes Provincial Park is about 3 hours from Vancouver, just past Pemberton. One weekend, my wife, a friend and I drove along the Sea-to-Sky Highway to Joffre Lakes Provincial Park.     The trail at Joffre passes three lakes, each a striking, saturated turquoise blue. We quickly approached the first lake and observed U-shaped valleys, jagged peaks, silt and lateral moraines created by Matier Glacier perched atop Joffre Peak.     We emerged into a clearing shortly past the first lake where the valley opened up to display a million shades of green. Inexperienced hikers might have difficulty crossing piles of boulders at this most rugged section of the trail.     For most of the trek we were in the presence of a powerful, churning mountain stream. We crossed it several times on crude bridges made of fallen logs. At the end of the trail we arrived at the majestic Matier Glacier where some hikers camped overnight. Waterfalls spewed from the glacier carrying blue silt, which colored the lakes below.

Manigotagan Paddling 70 kms of quiet, picturesque stretches of water that glides through boreal and deciduous forests, is turned to adventure when interrupted by spectacular rapids and falls. Manigotagan River Provincial Park  in Manitoba, Canada features impressive topography ranging from sheer rockfaces topped with craggy lichen and Jack Pine, to impressive stretches of Balsam Poplar, Elderberry and Green Ash. The Manigotagan River, meaning "bad throat", was long ago named by a group of hunters who when calling game were answered by an old bull moose with a garbled throat. The old bull may be long gone, but the tranquil spirit of the river can still catch you by surprise.

Solo 3-day backpacking hike in Banff Rocky Mountains Solo 40 km backpack hike to Howse pass in Banff Park, Alberta.  This is an abandoned fur trading route.  I show tricks for making life easy in the wilderness. The trail was in such bad shape, with so much deadfall, that I had to abandon my attempt to reach the pass. Check out Brian Patton's blog on this trail at: http://canadianrockiestrailguide.com/howse-pass-the-disappearing-trail/  He's one of the co-authors of my favorite hiking book "The Canadian Rockies Trail Guide".  Best part of making these video (other than the hike) is matching music.  For this video I used:  1:50 Instrumental version of Madonna's "Amazing" found on YouTube.  7:20 Instrumental version of the Tragically Hip's "Wheat King" found on YouTube.  The Hip are an amazing Canadian band from Ontario.  15:10 Instrumental version of Collective Soul's "Shine".  Done by Nick Scott.  He's on YouTube as Ambonick1 (https://www.youtube.com/user/ambonick1)  19:20 Instrumental version of U2's "Bad".  Great song by an even greater band.

Backcountry 2011 - Island Lake Canoe Route 720P Is best quality. 1080P has blur to it. Completed a trip into Island Lake Forest and Barrens Provincial Conservation Reserve on the Canada day long weekend. This Conservation Reserve is 45 minutes north of Parry Sound and access is via Wahwashkesh Lake. Ontario Headed up farm creek and camped on Wolf Lake for the first night, then continued into Dutton Lake and back to Island Lake for our final night. the route to Island Lake is fairly straight forward with easy portages, however when exploring the other lakes, portages can be rough to non-existent. Take caution when locating the portages between the small lake north of Wolf towards Dutton and the longer portage from the small lake East of Dutton into Island Lake. (the latter is riddled with multiple blazed  snowmobile and ATV trails, and there are about 5 portages blazed through here. The most straight forward is flagged and spray-painted orange. NOTE: Take the landing on the South-East side of the small lake and NOT the snowmobile opening as it is longer and easier to get lost. (Found out the hard way). Novice-Intermediate to Island Lake Intermediate-Advanced for access to the other lakes Makes a great 2-3 day trip or a relaxing week exploring all the islands and surrounding lakes.

The Castle of White Otter Lake This is my 22 minute documentary that tells the true story of Jimmy McOuat who constructed a castle singlehandedly out of red pine logs back in the early 1900's. The film contributed to the castle's eventual restoration which still stands on the shore of White Otter Lake in the wilderness of Northwestern Ontario.   The Castle of White Otter Lake was produced, directed, shot and edited by me, Peter G. Elliott and the script was researched and written by Elinor Barr of Thunder Bay. Jimmy McOuat was played by Nick Kaminecky and the original music is by Cathy Elliott. A special thanks to Gordon Pinsent who narrated the film for me for a very small fee. An extended thanks to friends and family who helped me back in the early '80s.  I shot this film on a $12,000 budget using my 16mm Bolex camera, an Ontario Arts Council grant and an editing room at The National Film Board. The film was shown on CBC's Canadian Reflections and on Global Television and various broadcasters in the British isles during the 1980's.

Air Force Day at RCAF Station Summerside - June 1963 8mm footage shot by my father, Harold Phillips, on June 15, 1963, which was Air Force Day at RCAF Station Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada.  My father and mother both volunteered for service in the RCAF during World War II.  My father served with the 119th Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron as ground crew in Trenton ON, Yarmouth NS, Sydney NS, Gander NL, Edmonton AB, and Watson Lake, YT.  My mother worked in special operations in Torbay NL and Sydney NS, plotting convoy operations and submarine surveillance in the North Atlantic.  There were many planes at this airshow, but of note are the Golden Hawks, the RCAF's aerobatic team from 1959-64 and the precursor to today's Canadian Forces 431 Air Demonstration Squadron (the Snowbirds).  You can read more about the Golden Hawks on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Hawks  The Golden Hawks had appeared in Charlottetown, PEI the year before, where an estimated 25,000 people jammed the roads leading to the air show (the population of Prince Edward Island in 1962 was just over 100,000).  Read about that day here: http://islandnewspapers.ca/islandora/object/guardian%3A19620820-003  Some great footage of the Golden Hawks in action from the National Film Board of Canada: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVo9InROAXY ['Royal Canadian Air Force (Armed Force)', 'Summerside (City/Town/Village)', 'PEI', 'Prince Edward Island (Canadian Province)', 'Golden Hawks', 'Argus', 'Canada (Country)', 'RCAF', 'Aerobatics (Hobby)', 'air show', 'Sabre']

Oregon Dave interviews Phil Cotton of the Wabakimi Project Oregon Dave Interviews Phil Cotton (aka Uncle Phil), founder of the Wabakimi Project, a unique grassroots volunteer initiative founded in 2004 to explore and document the historical and traditional canoe routes of Wabakimi Provincial Park in Central Ontario Canada. The end result is set of maps to help visitors plan and mount self-directed, self-guided canoe trips in the Wabakimi Area, a world class canoe destination.  Phil and I discuss why this area is so important and what the Project is accomplishing. At the very end Uncle Phil explains and demonstrates the purpose of the conical birch bark device I found near a portage into a small lake, while participating in the Project’s first trip of 2015.   Key Takeaways:  The Park was created in 1983 and expanded later to protect the remaining Woodland Caribou, a key indicator species. Access to the park itself is limited, making surrounding provincial parks and Crown lands important to map and protect as well.  The park and surrounding areas is much  larger than BWCA and Quetico combined, containing a world class canoe area that sees limited use. The mapping of canoe routes, portages & campsites is vitally important for the ultimate management plans to protect this resource for the future.  These plans are still in an early state of development.  As the Wabakimi Project comes to a conclusion in a few more years, the new non-profit Friends of Wabakimi (www.wabakimi.org/fow/) will eventually assume responsibility for the volunteer conservancy efforts to rehabilitate and document canoe routes in the Wabakimi Area and participate in planning processes to advocate for the protection and preservation of the diverse natural, cultural and historical resources of the Wabakimi Area that includes adjacent parks and Crown lands.

Canoeing South Saskatchewan River - Saskatoon, Saskatchewan The canoe is a Canadian wilderness icon.  It leaves no trace of its passage through the wilds, but it has left an indelible impression on the Canadian psyche.  Ancient aboriginals, early voyageurs and today's canoeists - all have been moved by the canoe - physically and spiritually.  With this in mind, it was only fitting that the GCAT crew spend an afternoon out on a river in a canoe.      We hooked up with outdoor enthusiast and owner of CanoeSki Discovery, Cliff Speer, for a paddle down the South Saskatchewan river.  Cliff has been canoeing these waters for over 30 years and is a firm believer that canoeing heightens the ecological senses.  He says it inspires a desire to care for the wild places that only a canoe can access.  At CanoeSki, they follow the environmental credo of respecting the earth in all their activities. This includes applying conservation principles to all aspects of the operation, practicing minimum impact camping, and contributing to local conservation efforts.    During our paddle we not only enjoyed fantastic autumn weather, but we were fortunate to catch some of the annual migration of Canada geese, snow geese, and sandhill cranes.  One of the great things about canoeing is that without a motor you can blend in with the environment and get the opportunity to truly be at one with nature.      If you ever get to Saskatoon and want to give canoeing a try, call Cliff and he'll be happy to introduce you to one of Canada's favourite outdoor pastimes.

RC CWR Douglasdale Trail with trailer in tow Down to the ridge at Douglasdale with the 2 Axial Honchos and cooler trailer in tow. Will and I took turns towing the trailer and mounted my new GoPro on board to test out a few different views. Trying to figure out what view we are going to use on the CTGs Urban Assault 5. If we take the cooler trailer loaded, we are going to need ALOT of batts to get through the down town run. Can't wait for the 28th so stay tuned for that video.

We are a father (Chris) 'n son (Will) team in Calgary Alberta, enjoying the hobby of RCs. Our collection of RCs include the crawlers Axial Wraith, Honcho SCX10, and Dingo SCX-10. Twin Hammer VW bug aka THug for scaling, bashing and hydroplaning with paddle tires on. For bashers we have the Traxxas Slash 2wd and Bandit. Drifter cars and or truck HPI Sprint 2 FLUZ and E-10. Scaler Tamiya F-350 and a cross over wraith axles under a bruiser chassis and body. Next are the Micro or mini Losi Trail Trekker and crawler customized 6X6 rally trucks flat beds and a short course truck. Another trekker is made into a custom 1/10 quad, with rider, for the axial scale adventures. We also have a 1/24 scale forklift from INDUSTRY FORK CAR, that helps out with our custom builds. 2 Forces of Valor tanks that are 1/16 scale and can shoot each other with infra red lights. Protocol helicopters one TOUGH Copter and one STEALTH HAWK. Hobby Zone Super Cub with a drop module.

We have made custom built flat deck trailers and 5th wheels for our trucks to pull along on our journeys through the parks and trails around Calgary and area. Plus a custom camper that rides in the back of PJ the Jeep Cherokee. As much fun as they are to drive scale crawl or bash, we enjoy the building and planning of new builds just as much. Nothing can beat the feeling of pride when a father and son team test drive a custom designed and built RC. No sooner do we finish a build, we are already talking and planning the next build. A hobby the whole family can enjoy and have fun with. Thank you for joining us on our builds and trail runs in and around Calgary. Thanks for watching and enjoy, please subscribe LIKE and comment.

Temagami Family trip. Canoe crash at Sturgeon River. Happy ending. 2015 We went to Temagami Provincial Park for the first time. Ahead of us was up to a week of paddling and camping in this part of Ontario. We started our tour happily at the top of Sturgeon River, and after a few meanders we saw a massive fallen tree blocking the river. The current was very strong, we couldn't manage to stop. We ended up broadside with the canoe sinking, luckily, to the right side of the river, paralel to the big tree trunk.  Everything went under the tree, the canoe, all the gear, ourselves...

French River Village Coponaning Ghost Town Saw Mill Alligator Ruins A trip to the French River area wouldn't be complete without a visit to the old Mill and Village Coponaning Town sites. The wreck symbols on the strip charts near buoy DC3  are supposedly from derelict "Alligator" tug boats left to die, all that remains are their boilers and pieces of tin. The area is now so overgrown it's difficult to piece together the mill site from a vintage low-res internet photo. Still lots of iron bits laying around, and portions of the original derelict steam engine. Anyone know the story about it?  Hard to imagine that a village of 1500 people at some point used to live here.

Waterway Tips #5 - Rice Lake Railway Cribbing When crossing Rice Lake along the Trent Severn Waterway (TSW), one must be aware of an ancient railway cribbing that straddles the lake close to the entrance of the Otonabee River. This railway cribbing was installed in the mid 1800's but suffered extensive ice damage and was abandoned after only six years of service.   There is a well marked spot to pass safely and is part of the main Small Craft Route that crosses in a east-west direction across the lake. Unfortunately, boaters who are unaware hit this obstruction every year - so keep an eye out for the markers and be aware of where you are!   Rice Lake is one of the largest lakes along the TSW, second only to Lake Simcoe.

The Trent-Severn Waterway The Trent-Severn Waterway has many interesting and unique methods for moving boats from one body of water to another. This time-lapse video demonstrates just some of the locks that can be found along the route from Lake Ontario at the Bay of Quinte to Georgian Bay.  Spending the summer visiting these locks, I was amazed by the engineering. Transfers are relatively quick, some as quick as 25 minutes for one sequence. This time-lapse video allows the visitor to see multiple transfers in just five minutes.  I have enjoyed "The Summer of Time Lapse". It reminds me of my film days. I would shoot a roll of 36 and then wait for the C-41 processing before I could see the images. The anticipation is similar with time-lapse, I have to wait for all of the images to be processed into a movie before I can see all the details and movement that I could not see while photographing the sequence.  Completed time-lapse sequences always surprise me, what is captured in the detail. Clouds would appear still during the shoot only to reveal their formation and movement in a time-lapse. Much like a macro image reveals microscopic detail, time-lapse photography reveals details of time and movement.  I have looked at many time-lapse movies by other Photographers. Some convey a serene or calm approach. Others get the “Holy Grail” day to night transition spot on. I love the added motion that moving the camera in some way brings. This movie only utilises the Ken Burns effect provided in iMovie.    I used a Nikon D7100 DSLR and the Triggertrap Mobile intervalometer on my iPad to trigger the camera. Most of the sequences were captured with intervals between 1 and 5 seconds. As the summer progressed, so did the capture settings. I went from Jpeg to Raw adding ND filters trying for the elusive 1/40, f3.5, and ISO 100.  I have invested in LRTimelapse and Adobe Lightroom for the digital darkroom. All sequences were rendered at 24 frames per second. The final movie was edited in iMovie.  Please let me know what you think in the comments below.

Waterway Tips #7 - Navigation Markers Change At Kirkfield When traveling along the Trent Severn Waterway, keep in mind that Kirkfield is the apex of the system. From this highest point on the waterway, it's downstream both ways. That means that the navigation buoys and day marker colours switch, in keeping with the 'Red Right Return' navigation rule.

The Western Brook Pond Fjord / Gros Morne National Park Newfoundland The Western Brook Pond is a Canadian fjord or lake located in Gros Morne National Park on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland. It is in the Long Range Mountains, the most northern section of the Appalachian Mountains.    Rock wallsIt is surrounded by steep rock walls 600 m (2,000 ft) high. Having been carved from the surrounding plateau by glaciers. After the glaciers melted, the land rebounded and the fjord was cut off from the sea. Salty water was eventually flushed from the fjord leaving it fresh. The catchment area is composed of igneous rock with relatively thin soil, so the waters feeding Western Brook Pond are low in nutrients and the lake is classified as ultraoligotrophic. It is fed by Stag Brook at the extreme eastern end of the lake and by numerous waterfalls cascading from the plateau above. One of these, Pissing Mare Falls at 350 m (1,150 ft), is one of the highest in eastern North America.    The lake is accessible by a moderate-easy 3 km (1.9 mi) hiking trail over coastal bogs and low limestone ridges. Two tour boats, one with a capacity of 70 passengers and the other 90 passengers, cruise the lake from June to mid-October. The lake waters are pristine, having had very little impact from human activities. The tour boat operators had to undergo special certification to ensure that their operations would have minimal impact on the environment.    In the early part of the 20th century, a part of the surrounding cliff broke off and fell into the lake, causing a 30 m (98 ft) tsunami.

Here are the Lyrics as requested  My Little Island Home   How I long to see my Island,  The place that I was born,  To gaze upon her rocky shores,  And the places I once roamed.   To see the sun arisin',  over Snatches Cover to start the day  and﻿ then see her nestle down,  In slumber out o're the bay.   From the Northeast River's rapids  To the Southeast River's shores  To see Mount Pleasant shinin'  from the comfort of my door.  To the Seven Island island lookout To the﻿ "Lane" in July I long to see my home I don't know how i will get by  I'm comin home again I long for home again My island calls my name For her son to come back home  And If youve ever been there you'll love here just like me I dont know why I left there It was just the powers that be  And its only for a﻿ short while that I'll call Alberta home Because my heart longs to be On My Little Island Home ['Newfoundland', 'Placentia', 'Newfie Music', 'Newfoundland Music', 'Song Writer', 'Guitar', 'Little Island Home', 'Island', 'bit', 'lullaby', 'total', 'angeles action', 'longer', 'music', 'sweet', 'orange', 'sister', 'dreams', 'drama', 'country', 'original', 'song', 'singer', 'acoustic', 'folk', 'guitar', 'original song', 'unsigned', 'artist', 'songwriter', 'musician', 'idea', 'composition', 'singing', 'vocalist', 'vocals', 'songs']

Red Deer, Alberta to Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta (Highway 11 Westbound) - time lapse During Easter weekend I made a couple of road trips around our province.  On the trip I tried to capture some of the scenic highways in the area.    This video is of a portion of Highway 11 from Red Deer, in central Alberta, to Saskatchewan Crossing on the Icefields Parkway.  The name Saskatchewan Crossing refers to the North Saskatchewan River which Highway 11 roughly follows West of Rocky Mountain House.    This route passes through the town of Rocky Mountain House which is named for an early trading fort of the Hudson's Bay Company.  It was established by an early explorer named David Thompson who did extensive mapping of the area West of Rocky mountain House and large portions of the mountains as far South as Washington state.  The Lewis and Clark expedition used some of Thompson's maps on their explorations.    The music used is Angels by Blue Rodeo.  This was filmed on April 5, 2010 at 20x real time.

Snowmobile Hillclimb on "The Onion", Smithers, 29 Dec 07 This was my introduction to the snowmobile hillclimb. Basically, the idea is to pilot your craft up the steepest part of the hill possible (to the left) without sliding or tumbling back down the slope to your death.  My dear uncle took it upon himself to raise the bar for the young punks, going through the rocks where there's not much snow. Hence the other rider opting out and looking over his shoulder in disbelief, while we all laughed our heads off!  But snowmobiles scare the crap outta me on the flat, there's no way you'd get me up there...

Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta to Penhold, Alberta (Highway 11 Eastbound) - time lapse During Easter weekend I made a couple of road trips around our province.  On the trip I tried to capture some of the scenic highways in the area.  This video is of Highway 11 from where it begins at Saskatchewan River Crossing on the Icefields Parkway to near Red Deer, Alberta.  I didn't go quite to Red Deer on the return trip, but left Highway 11 by Sylvan Lake and took the back roads home to Penhold.    This Highway cuts through a wide variety of terrain. It begins in the mountains near the continental divide, followed by the heavily treed foothills, and after Rocky Mountain House, the prairies.      The music used is Little Bones and At the Hundredth Meridian by The Tragically Hip.      This was filmed on April 5, 2010 at 20x real time.

Kamloops highlands in April A nice area to hike and geocache at Kamloops in my beautiful province of British Columbia.  To get here park your vehicle at the top of the hill on McGill Road, near the university.  It is a cold day towards the end of April, still feeling a little like winter.  The bit of color that comes with the moisture of winter and spring will soon be lost in the summer heat.  Looking to the west you can see the smoke stack from the pulp mill in the Mission Flats area of Kamloops, and in the photos towards the end of this slide show you can see the ponds from the pulp mill, as well as see the beginning of Kamloops Lake.

We are tracking her movements near Rocky Mountain House and Nordegg Alberta, Canada.

Blue Whale Bottlenose Dolphin fighting to survive. Close-up experience. Audio: Final Cloud by Kevin McLeod -  http://bit.ly/NNAtTA  This is not your National Geographic  photo essay of Bottlenose Dolphins and Blue Whales, but it definitely  shows our excitement. A family of Florida Gulf Bottlenose Dolphins playfully followed our boat wake on one trip. The St. Lawrence in Quebec gave us the Blue Whales. These ocean creatures are awesome and human friendly, although I sure, if they wanted to, could toss you around like a rubber ducky play toy. The Blue Whales literally surfaced within 15 feet from our rubber Zodiak - thrilling and exciting.   Blue Whales can grow to 100 feet (30 meters) long and weight around 200 tons. An adult Blue Whale can consume as much  as 4 tons of krill per day. The shocking part is that there's less than 5,000 Blue Whales left on our planet -- an endangered species.  They are fighting to survive.   Bottlenose Dolphins are the other extreme of the whale family, and even though they are not considered endangered, only 1 million of them left. To put that in perspective there are 7 billion of us humans.  The Bottlenose Dolphin grows to roughly 12 feet long and weighs about 1,400 pounds.   Enjoy and protect them. Take care of our oceans. Spread the word. We only have one chance.

Hundreds of Dolphins chasing The Cruise Ship Disney Wonder An amazing thing happened on the cruise ship Disney Wonder, a sunset stroll on the walking deck caused a chance encounter with a very large pod of dolphins.  There were dolphins everywhere!

Board Recovery & Self Rescue A lengthy story to this vid... wind was ramping up as I pumped kites, I went through it all; 14/10 & 7m Rises. The 14 had a weak valve that finally gave way and the 10 had too many pin holes in the LE so next I rigged the 7m.     During play time Chris tells me he lost his board and that it's most likely across the bay. So... @ 3:12 is when that adventure starts. I end up finding it after having a fabulous lengthy downwinder, try to bring it back but the wind totally dies, and for good. I end up self rescuing with the 7m in tow but at least we got his board back. Damn good times and OR saves LF's ass.     Heading home the setting sun was poking through the trees, saw a nasty collision then entered the twin sails marking your arrival to Cold Lake.

It's a really great  way to take in the beauty of the Bay of Fundy  wow that was a really cool experience to kayak on the Bay of Fundy we went out to  the Three Sisters and the Sun magically came out and lit them up for us then as we  were paddling back the fog came and its really ominous very cool to just see it  rolling in almost we think that ghost ship is just around the corner  You can go for a hike after kayak as well  Cheers to a good day, Cheers  We're camping on the Bay of Fundy  We see some seals, be very quiet, be very quiet  Well there you have it the Three sisters behind me here at low tide is a very  cool time to be here you can see the base of them.  This is an excellent view of the Three Sisters and a Pillar!  I don't know why they don't call it the Four Sisters, it's the Three Sisters  The Three Sisters are a magnificent rock formation on the Bay of Fundy.  Local Mi'kmaq legend states that powerful god Glooscap  Turned his three sisters into stone when he  left the land and bade them to remain until his return  Behind me is Elephant Rock. It really looks like an elephant  When it's high tide you  can actually kayak right through that so we will be back.  So there's the elephant that we walked to earlier   now you can paddle through it. Incredible  Just shows the power of these tides.  The Bay of Fundy has the world's highest tides  moving more than 100 billion tons of water every six hours and 13 minutes  that's more flow than all the world's freshwater rivers combined.  The tides range 35 to 55 feet  Every Day ['theplanetd', 'the planet d', 'dave and deb', 'dave bouskill', 'travel', 'adventure', 'adventure travel', 'tourism', 'gopro', 'sony', 'vacation', 'bay of fundy', 'kayaking', 'kayak', 'bay', 'nova scotia', 'water', 'sea kayak', 'new brunswick', 'kayaking (sport)', 'fundy', 'sea kayaking', 'paddle', 'hopewell rocks', 'canada', 'travel vlog', 'vlog', 'vlogger', 'travel vlogger', 'vlogs', 'drone', 'ocean', 'photography', 'whales', 'tidal race', 'rocks', 'sea', 'beaches', 'dji drone', '4k', 'phantom 3', 'dji', 'novashores']

The bulkhead were we offloaded was not suited to the cutaway ramp on the barge, but with a little more tide all went well. Most times we never new what the offload site was like till we got to there.

BC Ferries Daring Rescue of Man Overboard Original Footage.  People on the Powell River to Comox ferry said they saw the man jump from the upper deck.  The crew was quickly in the water to attempt a rescue but the motor of the zodial died.  They then had to put a second zodiak into the water to get to the man.  Luckily there was an ambulance crew on the ferry that tended to the man when he was brought back to the ferry.    Some said that he was a homeless man that jumped but the man himself said he fell (likely to avoid charges).  Police are investigating.

We filled in the gaps that the big boys couldn't pick up.... cost wise. Our loads usually consisted of several stops, so the barge was moved to differant sites till we got a full load south bound. Our missed load was picked up next time around. Check out Stryker Island video. My channel has been up for one year now and i appreciate the support from my subscibers. Cheers, Larry   ps.

Frozen, the Sea is frozen, but wait, what do I see out there, Awesome, amazing and incredible Looking to see what is going on across the road, and then getting a closer look at the great river that flows beyond the ice This Year has been colder than most and there has not been a big thaw or a storm capable of breaking-up the ice that has built-up with many successive extreme cold days/weeks. Even the tides have not broken-up the ice this Year, the flowing waters, mixed with ice are at the edge of where the eye can see. But with the use of deep zoom, I was able to capture the flow as it speeds along, far from shore, on the mighty St-Lawrence estuary (where the river becomes the gulf), here in Sainte-Anne-Des-Monts Quebec, on the Northern shore of the Gaspe peninsula.  merci de votre visionnement, prenez un petit moment afin de visiter https://www.youtube.com/user/danbythesea   Je vous invite a venir visitez mon site:  http://www.danbythesea.com/francais.html   thank you for watching,  take a moment to visit my YouTube page https://www.youtube.com/user/danbythesea  I invite you to visit my site: http://www.danbythesea.com/english.html ['Sainte-Anne-des-Monts (City/Town/Village)', 'Gasp\xc3\xa9 Peninsula (Location)', 'Gasp\xc3\xa9sie\xe2\x80\x93\xc3\x8eles-de-la-Madeleine (Administrative Division)', 'Qu\xc3\xa9bec (Canadian Province)', 'Canada (Country)', 'St-Laurent', 'fleuve', 'estuaire', 'estuary', 'river', 'sea', 'gulf', 'golfe', 'Water', 'Beach', 'Waves', 'Ocean', 'Surfing', 'ice', 'snow', 'frozen', 'freeze', 'cold', 'winter', 'season', 'weather', 'deep', 'extreme', 'severe', 'flow', 'pack', 'Amazing', 'see', 'awesome', 'Crazy', 'Cool', 'Best', 'Great', 'Incredible', 'Location (Literature Subject)']

Scuba Dive at Isthmus Bay Rd near Lions Head Ont, Canada Renee and I had a nice shore dive at Lions Head Bridge across the road from 239 Isthmus Bay Rd (see the map on the video).  The path down is a little rocky, so you have to be careful.  There is very limited parking for a few vehicles only.  Water visibility and temperature was better than at Cedar Hill Park.  If you need restroom facilities the best thing to do is use the public restrooms at the beach in downtown Lions Head before you drive to the dive site.  Our dive went north (left) where bottom depth is greater than to the south (right).  Due to silt it may be a little murkier near the lake bottom.  Hope you enjoy the video.

RC CWR river run NQD jet boat Took the NQD Tear Into jet boat to kananaskis county to do some creek runs at Evan Thomas and Ribbon Creek.

A snowmobile trip to the Gorge, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull, Newfoundland) On March 15, 2011, I went with a group of snowmobilers on a ride to "the Gorge" Western Brook Pond, Gros Morne National Park. Conditions were perfect, unlike 11 days earlier when we had to turn back because of high winds and whiteout conditions (see my other Youtube video). Our 177km trip took us over groomed trails and beautiful backcountry. This ride takes you into Gros Morne National Park. Before you head in, you need to pick up a park pass and a snowmobile permit. Contact the park before heading in. Any group planning the trip should have an experienced guide to lead the way. At 700meters above sea level, conditions can change in minutes from blue sky to whiteouts. River that were frozen over 11 days before were open on this trip. The Gorge is one of the premier snowmoblie trips one can take anywere.

RC CWR Trailin with the new Boat trailer for the NDQ jet boat Custom build boat trailer from aluminium, pulled behind the custom build SCX-10 deadbolt. What a great combo and what a lot of fun. Will and I head out for some jet BOATIN and had a blast. The trailer worked awesome and looks darn good too, I must say. It was a fun build, I just looked at a couple pics of what I would like and came up with this. Its 3/8 by 1/2 C channel aluminium, cut and bent then screwed together. No welds in it at all.

We are a father (Chris) 'n son (Will) team in Calgary Alberta, enjoying the hobby of RCs. Our collection of RCs include the crawlers Axial Wraith, Honcho SCX10, and Dingo SCX-10. Twin Hammer VW bug aka THug for scaling, bashing and hydroplaning with paddle tires on. For bashers we have the Traxxas Slash 2wd and Bandit. Drifter cars and or truck HPI Sprint 2 FLUZ and E-10. Scaler Tamiya F-350 and a cross over wraith axles under a bruiser chassis and body. Next are the Micro or mini Losi Trail Trekker and crawler customized 6X6 rally trucks flat beds and a short course truck. Another trekker is made into a custom 1/10 quad, with rider, for the axial scale adventures. We also have a 1/24 scale forklift from INDUSTRY FORK CAR, that helps out with our custom builds. 2 Forces of Valor tanks that are 1/16 scale and can shoot each other with infra red lights. Protocol helicopters one TOUGH Copter and one STEALTH HAWK. Hobby Zone Super Cub with a drop module. Pro Boat Mini -- V and a Blackjack 26 that is now a full time snow boat, weather permitting of course. Snowboating can be very hard on boats and boaters FYI. NQD Tear Into jet boat with Traxxas VXL brushless system. We have made custom built flat deck trailers and 5th wheels for our trucks to pull along on our journeys through the parks and trails around Calgary and area. Plus a custom camper that rides in the back of PJ the Jeep Cherokee. As much fun as they are to drive scale crawl or bash, we enjoy the building and planning of new builds just as much. Nothing can beat the feeling of pride when a father and son team test drive a custom designed and built RC. No sooner do we finish a build, we are already talking and planning the next build.

RC CWR Stormy weather jet boating with NQD 757 Tear Into Will and I hit the waves at St. Mary's Lake for some epic jet boating. With some stormy weather fronts rolling through the valley, the waves and wind started to pick up. Making it very difficult  to stay upright and cruise the lake. If we jumped a wave and had our boat pointed into the wind it would just flip us over. Will has to make some deep water rescues. The one rescue mission Will had to swim out to rescue the boat and then realized that he could just stand up LOL.  Good times on the lake, thanks for watching and enjoy. Cheers.

RC CWR NQD Tear Into Jet Boat trails We loaded up the Jet boat on a trailer and head for the river to hit some rapids. Gotta love this boat for river crawlin and river rock jumping. The plastic guard on the intake was broken and we ended up sucking up some rocks and destroyed the prop again. Good thing I bought a pack of 6 replacement ones LOL. So back to the bench for some repairs and we will be good to go again. I'll have to figure out a good system to stop the rock issue but that should be easy enough. We did have to cut our river run a little short with the jet boat tho. Theres some other really cool spots down there that we want to hit, so hopefully we get back out there soon :-) As always thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

A snowmobile trail ride from Steady Brook to Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull) Early in March 2012, I took a two hour snowmobile ride from Steady Brook to Deer Lake. A fantastic day of riding on the groomed trails of the Newfoundland and Labrador Snowmobile Federation. Western Snowriders and Junction Trail Blazers share this trail. There was some forestry operations but for the most part, it was a fantastic ride through rolling, twisting trail.

Creepy squatter cabin hidden in Alberta prairies Skidooing far into the prairies of Alberta and found this cabin in a group of trees about 30km from the nearest road.

RC CWR Boats, Boats and more Boats Miss Geico, BlackJack, Mini Mono, IOM sailboats, Tear Into Jet boats and a bunch of other boats. Chris from ARCH (Alberta RC Handbook) set up a - Let's go boating - day at Pine Coulee lake south of Calgary. We must of had a dozen drivers and close to twenty boats. What a great way to spend the day, with a bunch fellow RC guys racing boats on the water on a beautiful summer day. Some of the boats videoed very well and some not so much LOL. The Mini Monos are fast little darts on the water that are very hard to follow with the camera, a blast to drive, watch and race tho. And of course we had a few trucks out and about too. Everybody helping everybody fixing boats, rescuing boats, Aaron aka rookie101 even went for a long swim to help a few boats. Thanks to Lyle for helping and grabbing the camera to catch some rescue missions on film. It always a good time with these greta bunch of RC guys, links below so make sure to check them out.

We got some AWESOME on board footage this time with the Go Pro, as went flying down the snow covered river bed. It was a chilly -29 C' when we started and warmed up to -27 C' by the end LOL. But we were sweating like crazy, trudging through knee to waist deep snow for almost 2 hours. We had a blast out there on our chilly snow boatin journey. Thanks for watching and enjoy, hopefully we can get back to this spot for some Super Cub flying.

RC CWR TeamRaffee Co. trailer trail run with RC4WD Gelande 2 I took the Team Raffee Company trailer out for a trail run with Todd the red TF2 and Grant gray Gelande II FJ. I was pulling the new trailer behind my yellow Gelande II D-90. I also used the BoomRacing 10 mm wheel wideners for the trailer to give it a wider stance. Then I strapped down my Losi Trail Trekker Quad and off we went for a 4 hour trail hike. The trailer is built and looks amazing, this is the same chassis that I built my extreme off-road trailer on. It is a great trailer to build off of or just strap down some cargo and hit the trails. As always thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

Free salt giveaway causes chaos at Vancouver fire station Piles of salt arrived at several Vancouver, BC fire stations and it took only a matter of minutes before it was all gone. Anxious residents made a mad dash with shovels to fill their allotment of one small bucket of salt before it all disappeared.

The ice melting product was in short supply following a stretch of unusually cold weather.

Pack of Wild Eastern Wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park (www.algonquinpark.on.ca) This video shows a pack of 7 wild Eastern Wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada.  Watch as the dominant wolf feeds upon the White-tailed Deer carcass and the other pack members interact.  More dominant animals (holding their tails high when interacting) dominate subordinate pack members (holding their tails between their legs).  At one point a more dominant animal "pins down" a subordinate wolf who "relaxes" until the other wolf departs.  Common Ravens (the numerous birds) await their opportunity to scavenge for a meal throughout the duration of the video.  This is a sight rarely recorded.  Only 5 five wolves are visible at one time, but the whole pack of 7 is in the valley out of the camera's frame.    To learn more about wolves and wolf research in Algonquin Park check: http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca and http://www.sbaa.ca    Recorded from the Algonquin Park Visitor Centre viewing deck on Thursday, February 18, 2010 by Park Staff.

Eine Woche auf dem Yukon River Es ist die Zeit der Sommersonnenwende. Die Zeit der langen, warmen Tage. Des Tageslichts rund um die Uhr. Die Zeit, in der die Tiere Junge führen und sich im Fluss unzählige Fische tummeln. Es ist die Zeit, in der die Natur des Nordlandes erstrahlt. Eine Zeit, die geradezu ideal für unser Vorhaben ist. Die perfekte Woche auf dem Yukon River erleben. Intensiv. Und ohne Kompromisse.

Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park Wildlife 2008 This is my first vid and hopefully many more will follow.  This is not a music vid rather a bunch of wildlife footage with a tune added.  I figured music was better than the useless garble my colleagues and I rambled about.  The pheasant I was watching all summer long but only had one opportunity to catch it on camera.  I was hoping to get a bull snake mimicking a prairie rattler.  Hopefully I will get the footage this summer, it is an awesome thing to witness.  Anyways I hope you all enjoy my shaky camera hand, I will do my best to get it on the tripod more often in the future. ['Saskatchewan', 'Landing', 'Provincial', 'Park', 'Wildlife', '2008']

Acrobatic killer whales and dolphins We had a great whale watching trip through Aboriginal Journeys of Campbell River, BC, Canada (http://www.aboriginaljourneys.com), on Aug. 15, 2013.  Garry Henkel really knows what he's doing in getting you ahead of the killer whales, and positioning the boat so you get the best possible view as they come towards you. After spending several hours with the Orcas, he took the group on a trip to see a pod of about 100 Pacific White Sided dolphins -- we travelled about 100 km over a six hour journey.  Our trip was a prize donated by Garry to the Wild Ocean Whales Society (WOWs) as a fund-raiser. Our enthusiastic thanks to him and to Susan MacKay of WOWs, who operates a wonderful volunteer website tracking whales and dolphins on the BC coast. You'll find it at http://whalesanddolphinsbc.com.  If you're interested in wild whales and dolphins, we urge you to support both Garry and Susan.

Highland Backpacking Trail - Algonquin Park On June 3rd, I drove up to Algonquin Provincial Park and did my first solo backpacking trip. This is day 1 hiking from the trailhead to Faya Lake. The trail starts with a fairly steep climb with lots of rocks and roots to trip over and hungry mosquitoes, gnats and deer flies. Faya Lake is an incredible campsite and it's actually the only campsite on the lake so you are totally secluded from any other hikers, not to mention it's beautiful. I highly recommend camping at Faya Lake but just don't forget bug spray! The stars at night were the highlight of my night there.   __  Instagram - http://instagram.com/reid_zed/    __  Music  "Hold" - Vera Blue  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cv6JEjevKQ "Is There a Ghost" - Band of Horses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QremHCvOG-I "Wings" - Birdy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJTXDCh2YiA  __  Shot with a Canon 6D & GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition.

Ausable Conservation Area - Free Personal Dump For any inquiries on this issue, I can be contacted by leaving a common down below or sending me a personal message through this YouTube account.  ABOUT THE VIDEO: This is a video I have created in order to inform the local pubic about an issue that the Ausable Conservation Authority ignores. A local individual is using this protected conservation area space as personal dumping grounds for leaves, wood, grass clippings, old plants, dirt, household garbage, etc. They also use this space to grow their own personal plants and removes dirt for their personal usage. The conservation authority has been informed on numerous occasions, but no actions have been taken. This is located in Port Franks, Ontario, Canada.  MAIN FACTS -we have requested no dumping signs which they agreed to installed, but have not follow through with the request -there is a hole cut in the Conservation Area's fence in order to have direct access (shown in video) -there is various piles of this "debris" scattered throughout the Conservation Area, but the main pile is approx 100 feet long and 7 feet deep   WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM: -the Conservation Authority restricts the usage of motorized vehicles or horse, yet they ignore this dumping and the traffic of a wheelbarrow and a lawn tractor -there is protected vegetation in this Conservation Area, but the large amounts of "debris" is preventing the growth of this vegetation or killing any existing plants -these large leaf piles can cause a major safety hazard for the conservation area and risk the safety of the community around it -large leaf piles do create heat from natural rot, which does increase the risk of fires -this is an eyesore for the residence that lives near this and also to the individuals who hike through here ['ausable', 'conservation', 'authority', 'dump', 'dumping', 'garbage', 'free', 'informative', 'information', 'bayfield', 'port franks', 'ontario', 'canada', 'grand bend', 'lambton', 'shores', 'country', 'killing', 'hazard', 'fire', 'public', 'nature', 'natural', 'wildlife', 'plants', 'vegetation', 'animals', 'eyesore', 'issue', 'problem', 'grand', 'bend', 'port', 'franks', 'help', 'helping', 'horse', 'leaves', 'leaf', 'pile', 'household', 'house', 'home', 'grass', 'people', 'individual', 'individuals', 'safe', 'area', 'access', 'defacing', 'deface']

On Ryan Lake we caught a couple of brook trout and had a visit with a dragon fly. While touring Shall Lake we spotted a white tailed buck browsing under the hydro lines. Back on Crotch Lake I caught a nice smallmouth bass, we watched some more butterflies, found a garter snake and even got to see a beaver swimming back to his (her?) lodge.

1975 Expedition from BWCAW to Hudson Bay in 26ft North Canoe 1975 Expeditions of North America canoe trip starting at the end of the Gunlflint Trail on Saganaga Lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) to Hudson Bay, York Factory, and up the Nelson River in one North Canoe. This Expedition retraced Voyageur fur trade route along the US - Canadian border to Lake of the Woods, Winnipeg River to Lake Winnipeg, the Hayes River system into York Factory and Hudson Bay. Two Guide/Counselors and 7 teenagers paddled and carried the 350 pound wood and fiberglass 26 foot North Canoe the entire 1200 miles in 75 days, using only compass and US geologic maps, without cell phone or other electronic devices. Food canisters were packed and shipped ahead for resupply at International Falls, Kenora, Pine Falls and remote Hudson Bay stores in Norway House, Oxford House and York Factory. The group was wind-bound on an island in Lake Winnipeg for 5 days, but were able to secure additional provisions from local Cree residents at Berens River. Erik Sevareid's book, 'Canoeing With the Cree' was inspirational, and provided historical significance to the areas visited during the Expedition.

Located in the heart of the Thirty Thousand Islands, this place is only accessible by water, so visitors come in by boat and the numerous float planes that fly in. Not much to it, which is precisely why it is so popular. Boaters who wish to overnight here have access to shore power hookups and fresh water at the gas dock, although hey no longer sell fuel.   A great place to sit back, relax and give up one's cares :-)  Captured with Sony HXR-NX30U video camera & GoPro Hero 3  Location of this video (Henry's Restaurant): 45.17453 -80.13684  Filmed in July, 2015.

Fish and Sphinx: Illustrations by Rae Bridgman It's a very fishy tale...    Wil Wychwood's magical medallion weighs heavily on him. For once, he would like to live a normal life. Tired of bearing the burden of the Serpent's Chain secret society, he plans to toss the medallion into the rising river waters. But when the mists reveal a new mystery, cousins Wil and Sophie tumble into the secret realm of Catfysh, the Spirit of the River, and a plot to destroy the most magical building in Canada.    In this adventure, the world of magical MiddleGate intersects with the Manitoba Legislature - the Palace of the Blazing Star - where stone sphinxes, bison, lions, snakes and goddesses protect an ancient mystery. Cousins Wil and Sophie follow secret signs, decode cryptic messages, and work to solve a riddle to unleash powerful allies locked in stone. But even if they succeed, will they ever escape from the trials of the ancient medallion? And what will be the cost of their secrets and lies?

Worst hell-hole on Earth 09 - the Alberta tar sands - Flying into a thunder storm.   (Anthony Marr - www.HOPE-CARE.org) Since water in vast quantities has to be drawn from the Athabasca River, the processing plants have to be near the river, and thus their toxins-laden (esp. PAHs) tailing "ponds".  The water of the river and the Athabasca Lake is so toxic that their fish are deformed, and moose meat is inedible. The native peoples feeding on them have developed sky-high cancer rates.  And Dr. O'Conner, who reported this, could have his medical license revoked for his whistle-blowing.

Connectivity - The Restoration of 40 Mile Creek The 40 Mile Creek Dam once supplied Banff with drinking water and water to fight fires. Located between the two entrances to town, it was built in 1946, but hadn't been used as a water source since the mid-1980s. This project involved a partial removal of the dam structure to allow the water to flow freely, and removal of some exposed pipes.   The dam was decommissioned in May 2014. It was a joint project by the Town of Banff and Parks Canada with funding from the Province of Alberta. http://banff.ca/40milecreek ['banff national park', 'banff', 'events in banff', 'travel', 'national park', 'canada', 'dam', 'dams', 'deconstruction', 'history', 'River', '40 mile creek', 'connectivity the restoration of 40 mile creek', 'connectivity', 'park', 'decommissioning', 'fish', 'underwater', 'town of banff']
JEFF & BRENDA LEE LUTZ INVADE POLYNESIA...BORA BORA WILL NEVER BE THE SAME! THE GRISWOLDS COULD NOT HAVE LEFT A WIDER SWATH OF DESTRUCTION!!! This, our first youtube vid, was taped April 6-13, 2012. Most of it, including the fish "Feeding Frenzy" (ar, ar), was shot snorkeling under our bungalow No. 109 at Le Maitai resort. Jeff kayaked to the Sofitel private motu's coral gardens and did the rest there. Dunno where the stingray footage went. The GoPro Hero HD2 with a Blurfix adapter and URPro's SWCY filter did well in both clear and murky water. HD quality takes a big hit in Moviemaker and is also degraded in the upload. We have been spoiled by the Canon Vixia HV40, which basically allows us to burn the raw video straight to Blu-ray. Great cover tunes were chosen as a soundtrack but due to copyright infringement we utilized stuff Jeff had put down previously, mostly original tracks. A shout out to the great folks we met there...the Chicagoans / Serbians / Sicilians and  Albertans. The le Maitai staff are amazingly nice. This is a very special island and we will never forget it.

RIPLEY'S AQUARIUM of CANADA TOUR!!!! (Fish Murder Too!!!) Toronto, Ontario We tour Ripley's Aquarium of Canada in Toronto, Ontario for the first time! and see a fish get murdered...check it out!  ***SUBSCRIBE (If you want...I can't tell you how to live your life)*** Mike's Twitter https://twitter.com/mikekarschti Mike's Instagram https://instagram.com/mikekarschti Periscope: Mike Karschti Snapchat: mikekarschti ps. for those wondering how to pronounce my last name: Car-sh-tee  Ripley's Aquarium of Canada is a public aquarium in Toronto, Ontario. The aquarium is one of three aquariums owned and operated by Ripley Entertainment. It is located in downtown Toronto, just southeast of the CN Tower. The aquarium features several aquatic exhibits including a walk-through tank. The aquarium has 5.7 million litres (1.5 million gallons) of marine and freshwater habitats from across the world. The exhibits hold 13,500 exotic sea and freshwater specimens from more than 450 species. A Ripley's Aquarium was originally planned in 2004 to be built in Niagara Falls, Ontario[2] next to what is now Great Wolf Lodge around 2007, but plans fell through and Ripley's eventually relocated to Toronto.[3] Construction began on the attraction in August 2011 with a final cost approaching C$130 million. The aquarium opened to the public in October 2013.  The project was a partnership with three levels of government. The federal government's Canada Lands Company contributed $10 million to the project to develop the "John Street Corridor" linking Front Street with the aquarium, the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre. The Government of Ontario contributed $11 million to the project, and the City of Toronto provided property-tax incentives amounting to between $8 million and $12 million over the first twelve years of the aquarium.  Ripley's Aquarium has been the target of animal liberation groups such as TARA (Toronto Aquarium Resistance) and MAD (Marineland Animal Defence), which claim animal captivity is synonymous with animal abuse and regularly conduct protests and demonstrations at the facility. Prominent animal conservationist Bob Timmons has also publicly spoken out against Ripley Aquarium's capture of endangered tiger sharks. The aquarium holds 5.7 million litres (1.5 million gallons) of water and shows marine and freshwater habitats from around the world.[7] The aquarium is organized into nine galleries: Canadian Waters, Rainbow Reef, Dangerous Lagoon, Discovery Centre, The Gallery, Ray Bay, Planet Jellies, Life Support Systems and the Shoreline Gallery. It is home to 16,000 animals.  The Canadian Waters exhibit features animals from all the bodies of water surrounding the country. The gallery has 17 habitats. Some animals featured in this exhibit include: alewife, largemouth bass, American lobster, wolf eel, lump fish, giant pacific octopus, china rockfish The Rainbow Reef features animals from the Indo-Pacific water regions and is the most colourful gallery in the exhibit, hence its name. Some of the species in this exhibit include: Picasso triggerfish, humbug dascyllus, emperor angelfish, pajama cardinalfish, unicorn surgeonfish. The exhibit also features an interactive dive show.  The Dangerous Lagoon is an underwater tunnel with a moving side walk, which is the aquarium's largest tank. Some of the featured animals in this exhibit are: sand tiger shark, sandbar shark, roughtail stingray, green sawfish, green sea turtles. The Discovery Centre features various hands-on activities such as underwater viewing bubbles, a pop-up research submarine and a touch pool which allows visitors to touch living fossils. Discovery Centre inhabitants include: clownfish, palette surgeonfish, horseshoe crab, guineafowl puffer. The Touch exhibits give visitors the opportunity to touch the skins of various animals like sharks and sting-rays with the help of aquarium employees. This gallery is home to whitespotted bamboo sharks, brownbanded bamboo sharks, southern stingray, cownose rays. The Gallery exhibit, also known as Mother Nature's Art Gallery, features some of the most delicate underwater species from all over the world. This exhibit features the red lionfish, electric eel, lined seahorse, weedy sea dragon and the archerfish. This exhibit features six salt water and three fresh water exhibits. The Planet Jellies exhibit has colour changing displays with five species of jellyfish. These include: pacific sea nettle, moon jelly, spotted jelly, and upside-down jelly. The Ray Bay exhibit is focused around three distinct species of stingrays. Occasionally visitors can see aquarium divers feeding the stingrays during their daily interactive dive shows. Some of the inhabitants of this exhibit include the bonnethead shark, cownose ray, and the southern stingray.  The Life Support System gives visitors a behind the scenes look at the aquarium’s life support systems room. The building features the largest life support systems room of Ripley’s three aquariums. This gallery features equipment for Dangerous Reef and Ray Bay.

Starving Ocean - with Debbie MacKenzie and Farley Mowat In 2004, 20 years after a "deathly silent" response to Farley Mowat's "Sea of Slaughter" ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTJ1H0Zp6zQ ), my own observations on worrisome, visible changes in marine life - and on deficiencies in accepted fisheries science  - became the subject of this short television documentary on the "starving ocean". Farley was also interviewed in this piece, and he gave his views on why I was then being "frozen out" by the scientific establishment.    This show was produced by CBC and financed by Canadian taxpayers, including me.

Smokin' Fish Official Trailer For more information, to buy a DVD, or to contact the film makers go to:  Smokinfishmovie.com    Cory Mann is a quirky Tlingit businessman hustling to make a dollar in Juneau Alaska.  He gets hungry for smoked salmon, nostalgic for his childhood, and decides to spend a summer smoking fish at his family's traditional fish camp. The unusual story of his life and the untold history of his people interweave with the process of preparing traditional food as he struggles to pay his bills, keep the IRS off his back, and keep his business afloat.  By turns tragic, bizarre, or just plain ridiculous, Smokin' Fish, tells the story of one man's attempts to navigate the messy zone of collision between the modern world and an ancient culture.

When God discards Bad Fish In this message Pastor John examines Jesus’ Parable of the Net. Does God really discard bad fish? How do you know if you’re one of them?  “Once again [Jesus said], the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. “Have you understood all these things?” Jesus asked. “Yes,” they replied.” Matthew 13:47-51, NIV  “For this people’s heart has become calloused;they hardly hear with their ears,and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes,hear with their ears,understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.” Jesus in Matthew 13:15, NIV  “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” 2 Peter 3:9, NIV Images Payallarfishing by - ozgurmulazimoglu.

Pets, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger pets can be ridden and directly controlled!  ►Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! ►Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. ►Pets can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies! ►By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. ►Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your Pets can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points.  ►The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints.

Songs of Fishing Boats at Dusk (bamboo flute and zither) / 竹笛古筝二重奏《渔舟唱晚》 The music depicts hundreds and thoudands of hektare's lake. Fisherfolk are in a comfortable life and the boats are driving to the distance.   Songs of Fishing Boats at Dusk: a typical classical koto music of  He Nan. It is a sole koto music which has a board and deep impact since the third decade of 20th.  In 1938, Lou Shuhua used the old music 《Gui Qu Lai》as the fodder and developed according to the characters of koto. He cited the sentence "Songs of Fishing Boats at Dusk" of Wang Bo's 《Teng Wang Ge Xu》as its title. In the recent years, some people considered that this music was adapted by Jin Zhuonan from Shan Dong and based on the 《shuang Ban》 and the anamorphosis of 《Liu Shui Ji Shi》, 《Er Huan Tao Yue》. However, Lou Shuhua only has a big improvement on music book and add the later part of the music. However, both parlances are not validated.  The beginning of the music is in a low pace and in elegance which depicts the picture of the setting sun shine on the lake. Then, the tone is descending gradually and changing repeatedly. It adopts wusheng scale skill in order to display the interest of Songs of Fishing Boats at Dusk. Then, the most distinctive characters of this music begin. It uses the ascending and descending repeatedly and at the same time quicken gradually. The music is up and down which displays the wave and the boat drives to the distance. This music is an excellent koto music and adapted into two-stringed Chinese fiddle, koto duet and the sole of violin.    渔舟唱晚 乐曲描会了夕阳映照万顷碧波，渔民悠然自得，渔船随波渐远的优美景象。  渔舟唱晚：一首颇具古典风格的河南筝曲。是20世纪30年代以来，流传广、影响大的一首筝独奏曲。  娄树华于1938年以古曲《归去来》为素材，依据十三弦古筝的特点发展而成。并引用唐诗人王勃《腾王阁序》中"渔舟唱晚，穷响彭蠡之滨"为标题。近年来，有人认为此曲系山东金灼南根据《双板》及其变体《流水激石》、《二环套月》改编的，娄树华只是在金谱基础上作了较大发展，增加了乐曲的后半部分。两种说法尚未定论。  乐曲开头舒缓典雅，描绘夕阳斜照碧波的画面；接着音调逐层递降，反复变化，采用五声音阶回旋环绕技法，表现渔翁唱晚的情趣。接下来的是此曲最大的特色，就是用递升递降的的旋律多次反复演奏，并且逐渐加快，音乐跌宕起伏，表现了流水的层涌回荡，渔船随波渐远的情景，是一首蕴含诗情画意的优秀筝曲。曾被改编为高胡、古筝二重奏及小提琴独奏曲。 ['Song (Composition Type)', 'Dizi (Musical Instrument)', 'Guzheng (Musical Instrument)']

★ Minecraft 1.7 - New Fishing Mechanics and Changes (Pufferfish, Clownfish, Salmon) (#Minecraft) In this minecraft 1.7 fishing preview, I'll be going over some of the new features and mechanics related to the upcoming fishing changes that will be occurring with Minecraft 1.7.  At the time of this video, keep in mind that this is a development snapshot that is used so fishing mechanics can still change prior to the final release of Minecraft 1.7.  First and foremost, there are 2 new enchantments that pertain to fishing. Lure, and Luck of the Sea. One which gives you more of a chance to get something and another which increases the quantity of fish that you can hook around you, making it faster.  With Fishing, there are now new particle effects that help you while you fish. Bubbles will show up moving towards your lure right before you actually have something to fish out. This and this alone makes fishing much easier.  There are 3 new fish types. Salmon (which can be cooked and eaten), Clownfish, and Pufferfish (which can be used to make a water breathing potion). Note, do not eat the puffer fish. It will poison you, give you nausia, and hunger.  Rewards have also changed as well. You can now receive enchanted fishing rods, damaged fishing rods, bows, enchanted books (and with enchanted books, I believe thats a bit of an overkill reward), Name tags, Tripwire, Lillypads, waterbottles, saddles, rotten flesh, string, leather, bowls, sticks, boots, and undamaged boots.

Let's Play Hey You Pikachu Part 3 ( Hey You Pikachu N64 Gameplay ) - Hungry Caterpies & Fishing Let's Play Hey You Pikachu! Lindseys helps babysit some Hungry Caterpies and helps Pikachu go fishing by yelling "reel it in" and other things that rhyme with that.  We're rocking some Hey You Pikachu gameplay for the Nintendo 64 thanks to our good Pal & Patreon extraordinaire, Inutsu! Thanks so much for all your support Inutsu :D I hope you enjoy our play date with Pikachu!  Our Playthrough / Walkthrough of Hey You Pikachu includes a whole lot of frustration, confusion, and silly Pikachu hijinx. I think it was a pretty funny experience, and I'm glad to have been able to relive this nostalgia. The VRU mic thingy seems to work ok. Pikachu recognizes simple words that the game tells you to say. But sentences seem to go over his head. My Hey You Pikachu Review: It's very entertaining for about an hour! After that, it seems to get a touch repetitive. I remember really wanting to try playing Hey You Pikachu again after PBG covered it on his PeanutbutterGamer channel, and recently again when they did it on PG&Jeff!  Hey You, Pikachu is a Nintendo 64 video game developed by Ambrella and published by Nintendo.  The game features voice-recognition technology used to talk to Pikachu, the star of the game. It is one of only two games that utilizes the N64's Voice Recognition Unit (VRU), a piece of hardware that can comprehend and analyze the human voice. It is also the only game to use the VRU that was released in the United States. Similar technology has been subsequently built into the Nintendo DS and employed in Gamecube games such as Mario Party 6. The player can move around and pick up items, in addition to speaking with Pikachu and can describe everything.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Big thanks to Inutsu for supporting the show!

Compare Review - Ocean Kayak Caper vs Necky Looksha We did a two day portage & paddle trip and our friends at Trail Shop in Halifax hooked us up with a couple of kayaks to try out.  Check out the links below for additional information about the trip and the other kayak we used.  Our trip consisted of paddling about 20km and portage across the lakes of about 4km. We planned an overnight in a Yurt, so didn't need as much gear as regular tent camping.  Overall, I found the Ocean Kayak Caper very stable, easy to get in &out which was good for the portages as most of them weren't the easiest to get to. I was able to store pretty much all of my gear in the front hatch. I was surprised how much room it had.  If I had planned better, I could have fit everything inside including sleeping bag & pad. That being said, the hatch is not water proof. Waves went over the deck during rough waters and water did get in to get the dry sacks a little wet. But overall did fairly well.  The drainage holes (scupper) worked great especially when the water was coming up on the front deck. The holes under the seat were only an issue when you entered the boat saddle like.  I didn't find it tracked overly well in breezy conditions, I had to work a little harder to stay on track, however over clam waters it was easy to paddle.

Beautiful new ship "BlueNorth" in Guemes Channel, near the San Juans The new ship "F/V BlueNorth" built in Anacortes moves through Guemes Channel in what was probably a sea trial (on a gorgeous summer evening in the Pacific Northwest). See if you can find the tugboat waiting in the background... I believe this boat was recently built by Dakota Creek Industries shipyard.   Here's a related press release from Sept. 9, 2016 -- Blue North, a natural resource company committed to ecologically sound and humane practices, today will christen the F/V Blue North, the most modern, low-impact and innovative vessel to ever enter the North Pacific fishing fleet. The F/V Blue North has been thoughtfully designed with new technologies to improve the quality of harvested seafood and working conditions for fishermen.  Protecting water and air quality Unique features of the F/V Blue North reduce its environmental impact. All water and waste on the vessel is captured and treated, and nothing is left behind to contaminate the ocean. A state-of-the-art engine-cooling and heat recovery system recycles water used to cool the ship's engines, and repurposes the captured heat for creating potable water, creating hot water and heating the ship. These features mean less fuel is required to heat the vessel and no waste water is put back in the ocean. Engine power is monitored by a smart grid that detects electrical loads and appropriately distributes energy for maximum efficiency.  http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seattle-based-blue-north-christens-vessel-designed-to-transform-the-fishing-industry-300325327.html ['tugboat', 'ship', 'new ship', 'anacortes', 'guemes channel', 'guemes island', 'dakata creek shipyard', 'bluenorth', 'fishing', 'vessel', 'innovative vessel', 'sea trial', 'commercial fishing boat', 'pacific northwest', 'PNW', 'shipyards', 'new ships', 'new vessel', 'blue wave', 'boat building', 'fidalgo island']

Bluefin Tuna Chef Gordon Bailey, Lot 30 Restaurant in Charlottetown PEI Discusses Using It Read the original post about my conflicting review of Lot 30 and their sustainable fishing issues by serving bluefin tuna at http://www.baconismagic.ca/canada/bluefin-tuna/  Transcript here:  All we want to do is like cook the best like regional and locally focused food without being like too much of that farm to table. You know years ago when we opened this restaurant in 2008...   We don't always have to put our farmers on the menu, we don't have like to say like, you know like force feed these people that it's ahh farm to table but that's what we do. All our food comes from like local producers, farmers, fishermen. You know like we are the only restaurant to buy a whole bluefin tuna, which was ahh I think 574 pounds last year we're going to do another one this year. So you know to us it's like it's local, it's indigenous but what we want to make, the biggest thing for us is we want to make a challenge about it. You know challenge ourselves to make like the best that we can from what we're offered.  Post:  This is a really difficult post to write.  Generally I believe that if you don't have anything nice to say you shouldn't say anything. In this case I'm not writing to be malicious but to share a conflict in values. I've been on Prince Edward Island for a few days now in an attempt to see as much time as I can outside working. From a food perspective, Charlottetown has really surprised me. There are some great modern options and the island that boasts it produces Canada's best ice cream no longer needs to rely on that for culinary credentials.  After my cooking boot camp learning how to put a lobster to sleep,  Chef Ilona Daniel recommended Terre Rouge and there Chef Dave Mottershall told me the best chef on the island was Chef Gordon Bailey at Lot 30. And so last night I went and had fantastic food. The restaurant front of house is run by the chef's wife, Traci, who is incredibly nice and so down to earth. After the meal I asked if I could take a photo of the chef in the kitchen and everyone was happy to oblige.  And because of this I'm so disappointed at what happened next.  After a quick chat he asked me if I wanted to capture his philosophy for the restaurant on video.     This is where it gets really bad.     Have a look.     I wasn't struck by his disdain for helping diners connect the meal on their table to farmers on the island.  What disturbed me was that he was proud to serve bluefin tuna.  Bluefin tuna is not recommended by Ocean Wise. When I asked him about it he said that it is heavily regulated and his suppliers have licenses, which I am sure his true.  But bluefin tuna has been severely overfished driving critically low numbers. Despite it being delicious many people (including many chefs) believe there should be a moratorium. And while he referenced "PEI bluefin" this species is migratory, ambitiously so and are known to travel from North America to Europe multiple times a year.  Sustainable fish choices are complicated. Even within tuna some types are more sustainable than others so I often recommend using either the Ocean Wise iPhone app or the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch App which is available in Android. I try to support restaurants that have share my food values and I spend a lot of time reading about food. But most people don't and this is where I think chefs come in because most people ordering bluefin tuna from the menu likely don't realize it's unsustainable.  I didn't enter a debate with Chef Gordon. He was very kind to me and it's not for me to question his ethics when I'm a guest in his kitchen.    But it has left me uneasy.      Here is a restaurant with fantastic staff and delicious food but ultimately I believe we create the world we want by making choices with our pocketbook. Lot 30 does not need to confirm to my ideals. It's their kitchen they can do what they like with it.  If we hadn't had the conversation I would have recommended Lot 30 with gusto but now as great as the food is. I can never eat there again knowing I'm supporting a business contrary to my own values.  And with PEI having so many fantastic seafood options I think back to the last portion of the video where he says:  ...challenge ourselves to make like the best that we can from what we're offered.  The best of what we're offered is not unsustainable fish. Prince Edward Island is much better than that.

Gandy Goose & Sour Puss  Fisherman's Luck 1945  Terrytoons Opening with a few painful punful examples of various types of fish...a sunfish 'sets' and a starfish 'comes out', Gandy Goose and his pal go deep-sea fishing with the intent to land one of the denizens of the deep, with no luck until a whale appears.  Classic cartoons from the early 20th century until about 1950,  and classical music, early jazz and blues, some mountain music and children's tunes.  Everything here is child safe and child approved.  We have just about every animated movie short there is available on the internet.  They come from DePatie-Freleng and all their friends including Pink Panther, Ant and the Aardvark, Looney tunes, the Inspector and Merrie Melodies.

Stillaguamish Lower River Drift The drift from Arlington to the I-5 take-out makes for a nice day of fishing, around 6-7 miles. On this day, it was a quick float as we hit it at just the wrong time, with rapidly rising waters after a storm. It took use around three hours. Conditions totally wiped out any chance to catch fish, but it was good to float a new stretch of water.

You Can Get Anything You Want: On Schroon Lake, A Classic American General Store Still Thrives Produced for Mountain Lake PBS by Josh Clement (http://www.joshclementproductions.com) and Ed Kanze (http://edwardkanze.com).  Building on a history stretching back more than 150 years, the Adirondack General Store flourishes in the twenty-first century by offering the best of the old and the new. Maureen and Robert Diaz, who made a bold move from Queens to the remote hamlet of Adirondack to buy and run the place, are the hard-working proprietors. They sell everything from fishing poles to corn flakes, microbrew for grown-ups to retro candy for the kids, and even serve home-cooked meals. It's the kind of place you pop in to grab a jar of pickles and wind up spending half a day, browsing the aisles, talking by the woodstove, catching up with neighbors, meeting travelers, and reveling in the fine food and the old-time hardwood atmosphere.

Alaska via inside passage Traveled to Alaska via the Inside Passage June of 2015. We set sail in Bellingham and stayed on the boat for 3 days before briefly docking in Wrangell, Alaska and checking out Tyler's old stomping ground and family long house on Shakes Island. Then we hopped back on the Columbia to reach our destination In Juneau. In Juneau, we visited the Mendenhall Glacier, took a 10 mile hike in the beautiful Tongass National Forest along the Taku River, and hiked to Herbert Glacier We caught some wild king on Douglas Island. We also hiked the Point bishop Dupont Trail along the Gastineau Channel, where we saw tons of natural quarts, young jade, iron ore, and saw the remnants of the deck from an old cannery. Later we took the Gunalcheesh tram up to Mount Roberts, where we spread Paulines Ashes.❣ We wrapped the trip up with a few more successful fishing trips, basked in some waterfalls, picked some wild salmon berries and smoked a whole lot of fish (over 47 jars), before heading back to Seattle.

GoPro a New Zealand Trip First thing I did in 2014 was go on a month-long trip to New Zealand. I hopped on a bus tour company called Stray and met some fun friends along the way. Skydiving, night-time eel fishing, go-kart/luge, bungee jumping, skydiving, water-falls, singing around campfires, boot-throwing competitions, spelunking, glow-worm cave exploring, peeing off of mountains, goat hunting, kayaking with dolphins, climbing glaciers, helicopter rides, skeet shooting, naked pictures in front of epic scenery... To name a few. You name it, it was done here.  Enjoy!

Juneau Alaska Tour Of City And Mount Roberts Tramway In Wet Weather Juneau Alaska is the State's landlocked capital city. Weather In Juneau is humid and wet with rain falling an average of 230 days per year and an annual rainfall of 62.5 inches per year and snowfall of 86+ inches per year.  Tours in Juneau that attract the most attention from tourists are Mendenhall Glacier, Tracy Arm Fjord, and local fishing and whale watching excursions.  If you're visiting by cruise ship and are looking for really easy and simple tours in Juneau hop on the Mount Roberts Tram and tour the easy trails at the top or take a tour of Juneau on a local tour bus.  Juneau weather is very predictable. It's likely to rain during your visit but you can still enjoy the magnificent views from the top of the Mount Roberts tram provided it isn't too foggy.  Be sure to bring a compact umbrella and wear a rain resistant overcoat or windbreaker and you can still enjoy Juneau rain or shine.   People are always asking me how I made these videos with cool FX. If you're interested in how I made this video on my home computer and the software I used here is a link: http://millenniumtrail.com/Video-Editing-Software.htm  Note: This video is an original work created from photos taken during a visit to Juneau while on an Alaskan cruise aboard the MS Volendam. I created animaitons and graphic with photo and video editing software.

Juneau, Alaska 2008 My friend Ethel has a sister that lives in Juneau, Alaska.  So I jumped at the chance for a visit.  We took a trip through Tracy Arm Fjord to see Sawyer Glacier. There was so much ice in the water (in July!) that we couldn't get close to one of the glacial edifices. We saw a black bear walking along the edge of a cliff. We also went kayaking with the Bald Eagles in Sitka as well as Mendenhall lake, where we paddled between icebergs, explored the foot of a 600-foot waterfall, and got right up to the face of the glacier.  We went Halibut fishing and got our butts kicked (those things are freakin' strong!) We also saw a pair of Humpback whales feeding, and got to follow them for a few hours.  We packed a lot of fun into a week, but I'd go back in a heartbeat!

Moving the Lobster Factories 8mm footage shot by my father, Harold Phillips, in February 1962. My great-grandfather, Ernest A. Hardy, operated a lobster canning factory on the sandhills at Hardy's Channel, PEI from 1901 - 46.  He was also the lighthouse keeper of the Hardy's Channel Lighthouse. After his death, his sons used the factory buildings as a base for their lobster fishing operations.  In 1961, Milligan's Wharf was built and they moved the remaining factory buildings there. This footage shows the old cookhouse being hauled across the ice by a large plow driven by Harry Ramsay.  Also shown is the preparation to move one of the buildings from David Smith's factory.

Wildlife of Haines Alaska This footage was taken over a few days while fishing for Pink and Sockeye Salmon in the Chilkoot River in Haines, Alaska. The salmon run brings all kinds of wildlife to the riverbank to feed on the delicious and nutritious tough guys - grizzly's, eagles, ravens, seals and of course humans. Sharing the river with wildlife, a balance of respect and sustainability is important, especially when it comes to the grizzly's!  One bear, the lone bear seen eating fish in the river toward the second half of the video, is an old friend of mine.  BMJ is 29 years old now (born the same year as me) and I remember seeing her over several years, sometimes with a cub or three.  She has had over 9 cubs in her lifetime but I don't think many have survived due to tourists claiming them to be a "nuisance" when they have gotten into fish coolers. Sadly the solution was to kill them because they had gotten used to feeding themselves this way and weren't able to fish for themselves.  Apparently the last couple of cubs did survive due to rangers efforts to minimize contact between bears and humans. Typically grizzly's live to be between 20-30 years old in the wild.  I hope she lives out the last few years in peace after losing so many of her babies.

ALASKA extreme bike-canotto 2011 the lost coast Avventura Estrema "LA LINEA IMMAGINARIA" :18 giorni di esplorazione pura in una delle zone più remote dell'Alaska e del pianeta.  La costa selvaggia che si affaccia sul Golfo dell'Alaska dell'Oceano Pacifico.   Da Yakutat a Cordova.  Con la bici ed un piccolo canotto Maurizio ha percorso circa 500 km di costa fatta di spiagge di ogni tipo, sabbia, sassi, alghe, fango, paludi, boschi, fiumi, baie.  Purtroppo il mal tempo lo ha accompagnato per 15 giorni e si è scatenato spesso molto furioso che ha reso difficile e lentissima la progressione specialmente nella parte finale.  Infatti era stato stimato di impiegare circa 15 giorni con alcuni giorni di riposo.  Non è stato così ed il cibo misurato anche se razionato negli ultimi giorni è mancato completamente gli ultimi 2 giorni.   tutto era bagnato nell'ultima settimana, vestiti, sacco a pelo, l'acqua non si poteva filtrare ed era possibile bere solamente l'acqua piovana sporca di fango poche ore di sonno e tanta fame.  La parte finale per raggiungere la pista che porta al villaggio di Cordova era sommersa di fango, detriti ed il dedalo di fiumi creato in questa grandissima area fangosa era impetuoso, la nebbia faceva da sfondo e con il suo manto avvolgeva ogni cosa dandone un aspetto spettrale, Maurizio è stato costretto a rinunciare all'obiettivo completo, dopo vari tentativi per attraversare quest'area.  Tentativi rischiosi che mettevano troppo a rischio la sua incolumità, falliti con cadute in acqua e grandi scivoloni tra i tronchi ammassati .  La decisione molto sofferta ma sicuramente la più razionale e necessaria è stata quella di chiamare un elicottero della Guardia Costiera Americano.  Mancavano meno di 5 km.  Comunque una grande e unica avventura che dimostra ancora una volta che i sogni con determinazione ed esperienza possono essere realizzati.

Northwoods Vampires:  Leeches vs. walleye minnow (Graphic) We were camping on Lake 3 in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.  On the shore by our campsite, someone had made a little reservoir with rocks and sand to keep leeches.  While I was swimming, I caught a leech that was swimming by, and put it in the reservoir.  Later, I found a dead walleye minnow in perfect condition.  I dropped it in with the leech to see whether it would attach to it or not.  A few minutes later, I looked in on it, and was surprised to see that several more leeches had come out of hiding, and that they had already eviscerated the poor minnow.  They were attacking it savagely, and tearing through it like lampreys or hagfish tear into a dead whale.  It was fascinating.    Over the next several hours, I shot a few minutes of video every fifteen minutes or so.  By the next morning, the minnow and the leeches had completely disappeared.    I was planning on using music from "Jaws" to make a shark attack spoof, but that just didn't work.  I think the vampire theme works much better.

1 crayfish, 1 trout live in less than 1 min. 30 sec. Unedited; we were trying to catch a crayfish with a cup to show what a close resemblance they have to lobster, and just as we got a crayfish in a cup, a trout took the bait and the bobber went down. Cindy went to pull in the trout and I tried to film it underwater, unfortunately the water here is this red rust color and Cindy wanted to land the fish quickly so only a glimpse of the fish.

Water window This was an evening project that uses a piece of glass and a length of wood. It's great for seeing clearly through the water as if you were looking into a fish tank. It's handy for bedrock sniping just under the water's surface or for checking to see if there are any fish in the creek before casting a line or maybe for inspecting for cracks in the bedrock. I've seen similar units that use a tube with a round piece of glass at the end, but I like the large window version best, kinda like a big screen TV verses an iphone. I used a piece of photocopier glass because it's hardened but I think you'd do okay with any glass as long as it's thick enough to handle a little abuse. Any tub and tile silicon works well.

DIY Pulk Sled with only a couple weeks of winter left, I finally get out to test my DIY pulk sled.    using plans that I found on www.skipulk.com, we had to make a few modifications that I attempt to explain in the video.    - the plans suggested that you use a Paris Expedition sled but eventhough the sled is manufactured by a company in Montreal, they do not have any Canadain dealers??? They are available in the U.S. at a very reasonable price but the cost of shipping one to Canada would be almost twice the price of the sled. The sled I used was the Pelican Snow Trek 45 http://www.pelicansport.com/index.php?language=en&utilitysleds=snowtrek45    - 1/2" fiberglass fence posts are used in the plans for the rigid pole system but this was another item I could not find locally so I used 3/8" fiberglass chimney sweeping rods.    - my hipbelt required that I de-construct it to remove the webbing and pockets that were on it. I then attached 4 belt loops to the hipbelt before sewing it all back together. Running through the belt loops is a length of 2" webbing which forms the actual belt. Attached to the 2" are two shorter lengths of 1" webbing that were sewn to create the 5 webbing loops used to connect the poles. After building my hipbelt, I found a tool belt at Canadain Tire that could be used instead and would have been much easier. The foam padding in the tool belt is not as thick as my belt but would certainly do the job. Using the tool belt would only require that you sew on the piece of 1' webbing used for the pole connection loops.

We ran into a little rain on the way back to Dryden, but it was unbelievable what a nice overall ride it was - even with the lousy weather.  Larry really made it a nice flight back out.

Ocean Kayak Caper Classic Review - Kejimkujik Paddle & Portage Part 3 - BUY IT NOW ON AMAZON: http://amzn.to/1WNujrk  We did a two day portage & paddle trip and our friends at Trail Shop in Halifax hooked us up with a couple of kayaks to try out.  Check out the links below for additional information about the trip and the other kayak we used.  Our trip consisted of paddling about 20km and portage across the lakes of about 4km. We planned an overnight in a Yurt, so didn't need as much gear as regular tent camping.  Overall, I found the Ocean Kayak Caper very stable, easy to get in &out which was good for the portages as most of them weren't the easiest to get to. I was able to store pretty much all of my gear in the front hatch. I was surprised how much room it had.  If I had planned better, I could have fit everything inside including sleeping bag & pad. That being said, the hatch is not water proof. Waves went over the deck during rough waters and water did get in to get the dry sacks a little wet. But overall did fairly well.  The drainage holes (scupper) worked great especially when the water was coming up on the front deck. The holes under the seat were only an issue when you entered the boat saddle like.  I didn't find it tracked overly well in breezy conditions, I had to work a little harder to stay on track, however over clam waters it was easy to paddle.

20 minute Crab Trap !!!  zap straps and a milk crate~~~ I have a small sailboat, and with space at a premium, I needed a small crab trap and wanted it to be entirely made of plastic. All you need is a milk crate and handful of zap straps and whatever you can recycle for the front and the door. I strapped a 3 or 4 lb weight to the bottom and a small wire or plastic grate at the back of the trap to put bait behind. elastic bands can spring load the door so that it opens when it hits the bottom.   Bait can be anything but a can of sardines is fast and easy and seems to always catch em. I generally put a few pieces of bread in too...it seems to bait the water a bit going down with crumbs and brings the crab running..  Wait 20 or 30 minutes and cross your fingers!! I like 30-40' deep for Dungeness crabs and 20-25 for rock crab on a sand or mud bottom. Good fishin!!! ['simple', 'inexpensive', 'crab', 'trap', 'crabbing', 'catching', 'seafood', 'Fishing', 'Food']

Who should govern nature? People often feel that the government should be in charge of natural resources because the environment belongs to us all and the government represents the people. While there's no single way for renewable resource ownership, people tend towards government control a little too often.  It can hurt instead of help.

Deception Pass State Park's North Beach This video taken August 25, 2012 of North Beach in Deception Pass State Park. This beach area gives you great views of the Inlet Passage of Deception Pass, Deception Pass Bridge and Fidalgo Island. This area is frequented by lots of fisherman trying to catch the different salmon species as they make their way through the passage on their way up the Skagit River. A number of divers will take their chances here but there are very strong currents pushing through this passage due to low and high tides. Not a place for non-motorized boats in my opinion. An special place to checkout so if coming to Deception Pass State Park you need to hike down the trail to North Beach.

Crabbing Everett 10 28 15 Another unsuccessful attempt at getting a few crabs for dinner. We got 14 nice size ones but the only two that were legal size were females.  We used a couple of salmon heads for bait and the crabs loved them. Still, a sunny afternoon spent crabbing is what retirement is about. I doubled the speed for a few segments but it still turned out to be almost 39 minutes.  Some highlights are when the bait box comes open at 7:56 and the crabs figure out how to get it all the way open at 13:30.  Sorry for the non action packed parts but there is plenty of action if you are patient and the current flowing through is soothing.

Exploits River October Flood 2016 Badger Cute Oct 11th 2016 there was an epic amount of rainfall that caused flood conditions for several communities in Central Newfoundland.  To those suffering loss and damages, our hearts and thoughts go out to you. This Video was made more for those of us greatly familiar with our trip.  I thought the curious people would like to see what flood conditions looked like for us.  This is not a promotional video and I didn't do much in the way of editing so bare with the poor quality.  Also, we took proper precautions, used proper safety gear, and we are white water rescuers.  Do not attempt anything you see in this video without consulting safety professionals and use proper equipment. ['Exploits', 'river', 'newfoundland', 'central', 'flood', 'high', 'water', 'rafting']

The 2hp pushes it along at about 2-5 km/h. If you're looking for a boat and you see a Lifetimer, get it.

Sketchy ATV Trail - Pt. 2 - Cubbee Tries To Defy Gravity - Aug. 21, 2014 Part 2. Once again we were attempting to get to Gullwing and ended up getting sidetracked.Thought we would try to find a short cut cross country to the sketchy trail that CK had to use diff lock on earlier in the year.  We made it, but our short cut trail turned into a four hour ride that you couldn't really call an ATV trail.  Did I mention there were bugs?

Dec. 27 2013 - A Quick Check Of The Ice On The ATV's Happy New Year! This extreme cold we have been having for the past month and a half has really sucked! A one day break from the cold, had us out on the Grizzly and Kodiak to check out the conditions of the ice on the lake for the first time this season. Seems to be a lot of ice, unfortunately with all the snow we have had this year, there is also a lot of slush. We made it across the lake ok this time, but since this video was taken, the conditions have gotten much worse. Hopefully, the weather is supposed to improve by the weekend and we can then put the tracks back on the Grizzly.   If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

In Search Of The Rock Igloo On ATV - Apr. 26 2015 We had a viewer send us some info on a cool "rock igloo" looking thing he came across while hunting in the area. Not sure if it is something that the railroad company used to store explosives in or just what it is. Unfortunately, we were only able to get within a half mile of it no matter what direction we came from. We will have to go back and try again one day. We did have an awesome day of exploring as we have never been on some of these trails before.   If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

Yamaha Kodiak And Grizzly Find A Little Mud Near Contact Bay - June 30 2012 South of town this time. Out in the Contact Bay area. It usually has lots of ticks, only came across one this time out!  Came across a few mud-holes that we were able to make use of the Zilla's in. They seem to work great. Had been here a couple years ago on the old Honda's with stock tires and we really got stuck. Not happening this time! Took a break and parked in the water in Trap lake. Looked down and there was a walleye fish that swam right up to us! About a 2 pounder. Pretty cool!

Winter All Terrain Vehicle Tracking On The Yamaha Kodiak & Grizzly - Jan.17, 2015 Yamaha All Terrain Vehicles on Commander TRACKS!  Can you hear me now??? Unfortunately, we had some audio problems on this ride. Turns out that one of the new helmet communicators we were trying had a problem. It has been sent in for repairs so hopefully we won't have that happen again. The Yamaha's and Kimpex Commander tracks worked flawlessly though and we had a heck of a good time tracking around north of town.

Yamaha Grizzly's Crossing The Ice To Fox Island - Boxing Day 2011 Happy New Year and I hope everyone had a great Christmas! We venture out for a ride across the lake to Fox Island aboard the Yamaha Grizzly 700 and the Kodiak 450. There has been more snow falling lately, but it still isn't too bad going with the Yamaha's. Trying out our new GoPro Hero 2 this day. Too bad there wasn't a bit of sun to make it look better. Filmed it in 1080p just to try something different. Watch it in full screen for maximum viewing pleasure! lol    http://www.facebook.com/cubbeezx ['Yamaha', 'grizzly', 'kodiak', '700', '450', 'gopro', 'hero2', 'cubbeezx', 'atv', 'snow', 'ice', 'lake', 'road', 'fishing', 'fire', 'cliff', 'donuts', 'All-terrain Vehicle', 'Quad', 'Winter', 'Four', 'Outdoor Sports', 'extreme', 'winter', 'sports', 'riding']
Yamaha Grizzly ATV On Tracks  1 - Arctic Cat ZL440 Stuck In Slush 0 - CK Gets Stuck - Mar.24 2013 On March 24th we went out with the Grizzly on tracks and the ZL 440.  Weren't planning on having any major adventures, but when CK got stuck in the slush things changed.  Somehow the actual video footage of the "extraction" has disappeared.  Maybe CK had something to do with it, LOL.  Had to be careful not to get the Grizzly stuck and the winch wouldn't even pull it out...just kept digging it deeper.  We had just started digging when  2 friendly snowmobilers came along and gave us a hand!  They helped us lift it out and turn it around.  If it hadn't been for them we would have been there awhile.

Grizzly Kodiak & Sportsman Conquer 7 Mile Road From Minnehaha To Gold Rock Out with some friends and their Polaris Sportsman 400, to check out the trail to Minnehaha. This is where the boats would come from Wabigoon and dock at Boudreaus's Landing. The people and cargo would then be transported to the gold mines at Gold Rock by land from there. Quite the place in it's day I hear!  This was quite a short trail so we then thought we would just "check" the trail from there to Gold Rock which was formerly known as the "7 mile road".  You weren't supposed to be able to go up this road because of damage caused by beaver flooding, but the first part looked pretty good, so we carried on. About half ways in, the trail definitely turned into quite a challenge and work-out!! There were a couple of detours around the flooded areas which turned out to be quite the ride!! Took about 4.5 hours to go 7 miles. But, I guess we made it. This just in....you can go to Gold Rock that way. Well at least at this time of the year. Might have been impossible when it was wet. We actually were back exploring around the mine areas this past weekend, watch for an upcoming video on that in the near future!

Testing a Pungo 120 kayak This is a very stable kayak. Notoriously stable. But, we wanted to know what it took to flip it over (not a kayak roll)? We put the kayak in a friend's pool and found the point of no return. The flip occurs around 1:00. You can almost get the water line to the coaming. In very choppy water we have found the kayak to be very stable and predictable if you keep your hips loose, like you're supposed to. It's a great first kayak for recreational use.

{ADVENTURE} Stony Rapids SK by Motorcycle F800GS / XR 650L / KLR 650 As far as i know we are the first to make it the whole way to Stony Rapids, Saskatchewan Canada by motorcycle.  Enjoy our adventure. And for anyone wanting to complete this journey, if the road seems to nice all the way to points north, its just baiting you in.  Bring a extra disregard for the well being of your bike and comfort for the last 220km to Stony.  90km of rough gravel with sharp rocks sticking out 3-4 inches, 50km of sand and what could be best described as gypsum, and then the remainder in 4-5 inch deep shale razors.  But totally worth it. ['Stony Rapids', 'f800gs', 'xr650l', 'klr650', 'daniel leppington', 'scott lepp', 'Thomas bolder']

At first, she is seen as a little naive and insecure as a result of being sheltered for most of her life. She's fiercely loyal to her "aunts" and obeys their rules respectfully, no matter how much she dislikes them. In later media, she is shown to have matured and become more self-assured, independent and confident in her opinions and abilities.  Belle:  Princess Belle ("Belle" meaning "beautiful" in French) is the female protagonist of Disney's 1991 film Beauty and the Beast and the protagonist of its 1997-98 direct-to-video saga midquels, The Enchanted Christmas and Belle's Magical World.  Personality Belle has gained a significant amount of intelligence over the years due to her love of books, providing her with a wide vocabulary, active imagination and open mind. She is very confident and outspoken in her opinions, and seldom likes being told what to do. Unlike most characters in the film, Belle isn't concerned about hers or other's appearances, and is able to look past how people appear and into their hearts. This is how Belle managed to break the Beast's enchantment, and restore love and laughter to the castle.  Cinderella:  rincess Cinderella is the protagonist of Disney's 1950 animated film of the same name and its 2002-07 sequels in the saga. She was voiced by the late Ilene Woods in the original film and is currently being voiced by Jennifer Hale. She is the 2nd official Disney Princess by chronological order and the oldest by age, her being 19.  Personality Cinderella is a headstrong and independent young woman who is truly beautiful because she doesn't let her anger and sorrow get the better of her. She is kind to most and is in no way depicted as naive or childish. She is extremely mature and has shown that she can overcome her obstacles without the aid of magic. She has also been shown to have a slight sarcastic side to her, as seen in her comments about her step-family and Lucifer, but usually keeps such comments to herself. Cinderella has shown to be rather intelligent and clever especially considering how poorly raised she was after the absence of her biological parents. She is also resourceful by using her mother's old fashioned dress and imagining a beautiful ball gown. She is shown to be very patient and calm, but she also has a mean side in her as she has once tried to hit Lucifer with a broom and on one occasion ordered Bruno to banish Lucifer (this is reasonable since she was locked by her stepmother and her friend was in danger). She is rather clumsy as she drops her footwear many times in the original movie.  Snow White:  Princess Snow White, or Snow for short, is the heroine and the titular character of Disney's first animated feature-length film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs since 1937. She is a young Princess; the "Fairest of Them All" who, in her innocence, cannot see any of the evil in the world. This makes her more vulnerable to her jealous stepmother the Queen, who wishes to be the fairest in the land; however, Snow White's inherent kindness and purity inspires her friends, the forest animals and the Seven Dwarfs to protect her. In the film, she is both a protective mother figure and an innocent child in her relationship with the forest animals and the Seven Dwarfs. She was voiced by the late Adriana Caselotti in the original film, and is now voiced by Katherine Von Till. She has also been voiced by Carolyn Gardner in other appearances. She is the 1st and youngest official Disney Princess and provided the basis for later heroines such as Cinderella and Princess Aurora.  Personality Snow White is the sweetest and the most gentle of all the Disney Princesses. She's naïve, resilient, sentimental, helpful and kind, but is also strict as she warns the dwarfs if they don't wash their hands they get nothing to eat and scolds some of the birds after they pecked at the Queen in her old hag form.  She is also slightly cheeky after she teased Grumpy by laughing after he hit his nose when he left to wash in a huff. This video is by PezRacer (Pez Racer)!

Injecting New Life Into Aging Infrastructure - Manitoba Hydro Since September 2013, Manitoba Hydro has repaired aging cables through an innovative process of silicone injection.  This process will extend the cables' life another 40 years. In addition to being innovative, the process is extremely cost efficient. The estimated cost to replace 30 km with new cable is $1,500,000 compared to the cost of silicone treatment at $750,000. Hydroseeding is the latest rehabilitation activity at Wuskwatim Generating Station to restore the site to a more natural state.Read more about Manitoba Hydro and system renewal at: http://www.hydro.mb.ca/projects/system_renewal/index.shtml ['manitoba', 'hydro', 'cables', 'silicone injection', 'repair', 'system renewal']

Watch Tornados On The Sun Tornadoes are well known to cause plenty of havoc on Earth, but who would've guessed that they were also hitting other areas of our solar system? A recent video released from NASA’s Solar Dynamic Observatory shows a speeded-up version of a 38-hour tornadic incident on the sun, an example of potentially dangerous "space weather."  Throughout the one-minute clip, multiple tornadoes can be seen making contact with the sun. According to Space.com’s YouTube page, the footage captured June 3-4 shows plasma moving across the sun’s surface, which is also commonly referred to as “sun tornadoes.”  At a Space Weather Enterprise Forum conference on June 4 at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Auditorium and Science Center in Silver Spring, Md., NASA chief Charles Bolden said space weather can be equally as devastating as the weather on Earth. "This conference shines a spotlight on another naturally occurring phenomenon that can be just as punishing as a tornado: space weather," Bolden told Space.com.  He said strong solar storms in space can interfere with communication satellites aimed at our planet, and NASA has recently joined with the United Nations in an effort to better understand the impact of space storms on Earth.  “Space weather is a problem that crosses all borders and demands input from our international counterparts," he said. “We have shown how, working as a team, we can save lives when hurricanes and tornadoes strike here on Earth. I am confident we can be just as effective working together to protect our people, our critical infrastructures, and our planet from the dangers of space weather.” ['astronomy', 'sun', 'Solar Tornadoes:', 'NASA Solar Dynamic Observatory', 'NASA (Spacecraft Manufacturer)', 'Space Weather Enterprise Forum', 'space storms']

If you buy one of these make sure you read all the instructions fully first.  I can see there will be a steep learning curve with this and I can already see how the GoPro video is better. The camera that comes with this unit does take fantastic photos so I guess it depends on if you want to use for video or photos.  There will be many more videos to follow.

Interview with Robert Hawkins - MLA for Yellowknife Centre Interview with Robert Hawkins - MLA for Yellowknife Centre.  Robert Hawkins cites economic and health and safety reasons for keeping the City Center Airport open. The Muni is an economic doorway to the City of Edmonton, and is part of the fabric of the city. Yellowknife is an economic generator for Edmonton and should have been consulted as a stakeholder. This move may sever the relationship with Edmonton. He does not feel redevelopment of the airport land will play out as suggested.

Agressive swallow dive-bombs within inches of your head At a certian time of year, when the swallows, nesting at the Sutherland Observatory have their chicks, they get extremely agressive!  Anyone who dares to go outside, get dive-bombed! They actually get within a few centimetres from one's head, such that you can feel the wind from their wings. To cap it all, at that point, they make a sharp screeching sound, giving you quite a fright when not expected.

Север Саскачевана. Поход по лесам. Рыбалка. Часть 2. 24-25.08.2013 Предпоследний выходной августа мы посвятили разведке. Выехали в леса и прошлись по незнакомому региону за рекой, по местам, где мы не бывали раньше. Места оказались хорошими и многообещающими, в изобилии встречались следы маралов, медведей и лосей. Точного местоибитания лосей мы к сожалению не нашли, да и невозможно найти таковые летом, в жару. Зато река как всегда порадовала чудесной рыбалкой, прохладой и неописуемой красотой и покоем.

Vansky Inflatable Lounge Chair Review.  Love it or list it? Watch as I tried to drown the Vansky inflatable chair by flipping my canoe over on top of it in 6 degree Celcius on a very windy day.  lol.  On the second part of the test,  I took it for a swim and used it as a dry bag.  Man was it cold but the chair held up and my sweater I had inside the chair stayed dry. See what I had to say about all of this. P.S.  Kinda funny when my canoe went adrift.  P.S. Not sure if you can make  love on it or not but I did everything else on it.

Groundbreaking of TELUS Data Centre Today, Premier Christy Clark joined TELUS to break ground on a new Internet data centre that will bring more than 200 constructions jobs and up to 75 permanent jobs to Kamloops and British Columbia. The TELUS Data Centre will allow organizations to store their data in what will be one of the most energy-efficient, sustainable and secure facilities of its kind in North America. This $75-million development is being built to LEED Gold standards and will use up to 80 per cent less power than a typical data centre of its size.  Technology is one of the eight key sectors identified in the BC Jobs Plan. As part of the plan, the B.C. Government is growing British Columbia's tech sector by opening up new markets for high-tech products and solutions, while creating a positive environment for long-term job growth. Over 84,000 British Columbians work in the technology industry and jobs in technology are growing twice as fast as overall employment growth in the province.

GoPro HERO4 UltraHD - Ziptrek Zipline Fun Whistler, British Columbia in UltraHD GoPro HERO4 Order & Info - http://goo.gl/C5FeJV  The GoPro 4 is the latest GoPro camera.  For everyone not already familiar with GoPro, a GoPro is an action camera that will mount to almost anything.  A GoPro camera creates a video experience where you feel like you are right there with the action that is being filmed with the GoPro.  The GoPro 4 comes in three different models.  The GoPro HERO4 Black films 4K video at 30FPS and 1080P HD video at 120FPS.  The GoPro HERO4 Silver films 1080P video at 60FPS.  The least expensive GoPro 4 (simply called "HERO") still films at an impressive 1080P 30FPS.  One of the best things about GoPro is that as they release newer GoPro camera models, most all of the GoPro mounts that one already owns will likely continue to work.  This makes upgrading to the latest GoPro camera model both smart and less of a financial burden.

SPEEDWRAP® Kwik Bandit™ Kwik Bandit™ is a new, patent-pending line of reusable, rubber straps and tie down fasteners. With Kwik Bandit straps users simply stretch, wrap and lock objects together for an extra secure hold. Developed in Canada for safety-conscious users in the oil, gas and transportation industries, the product is now available to end users, distributors and retailers in the United States and Mexico.    Kwik Bandit™ straps are reusable and robust, serving as a complimentary product line to Speedtech’s SPEEDWRAP® brand hook and loop fasteners.   As the exclusive Master Distributor for the United States and Mexico, Speedtech is looking for qualified industrial and retail distribution partners for the Kwik Bandit™ product line.   What makes Kwik Bandit™ so unique?    Kwik Bandit reusable straps are ideal for securing loads, organizing cables, cords and hoses, managing electrical wires and much more. Made from an extremely durable compound, Kwik Bandit products also feature pre-set locking locations to accommodate a wide range of banding and bundling applications. The Kwik Bandit line is sold in a variety of sizes, covering a range of tensile strengths. Several of the straps are offered with a lock pin for the safety conscious consumer.  Fasteners and User Safety Concerns:   When safety is a concern, Kwik Bandit products out-perform many bungee cords and elastic straps with metal hooks. The metal-ended, elastic tie downs often store energy and are prone to a ‘snap back,’ which can be both unpredictable and dangerous. OSHA and other agencies have begun evaluating the potential harm presented by bungee cords and other ‘stretchy’ fasteners that include metal hooks. To learn more about the safety implications when using Kwik Bandits™ vs alternative solutions, visit www.speedtechinternational.com/kwikbandit today.  About Speedtech International:  Founded in 1994, Speedtech pioneered the development of unique fasteners for use in cord and cable management. Centrally located in the United States, Speedtech is a growing, customer-centric company with ISO 9001:2008 Certified Quality Systems and sells domestically and internationally.  Speedtech supports both the consumer and industrial marketplace, selling product directly to consumers and OEM’s as well as through Authorized Distributors and Retailers.   For more information about the new line of Kwik Bandit fasteners, including how to become a Kwik Bandit Distributor or Retailer, contact Speedtech International today at www.speedtechinternational.com/kwikbandit.aspx,  email us at sales@speedtechinternationalcom  or call 1-800-771-3896.

Lama au Galerie de la cap Lama is a genus containing two South American camelids, the wild guanaco and the domesticated llama. This genus is closely allied to the wild vicuña and domesticated alpaca of the genus Vicugna. Before the Spanish conquest of the Americas, llamas and alpacas were the only domesticated ungulates of the continent. They were kept not only for their value as beasts of burden, but also for their flesh, hides, and wool. ['Trois Rivi\xc3\xa8res', 'cap de la madeleine', 'lama', 'poulet', 'Qu\xc3\xa9bec', 'Canada']

"Action on the Columbia" a 1965 BC Hydro film about the Columbia River Project On Sept. 16, 1964, Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, B.C. Premier W.A.C. Bennett, and U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson ratified an international agreement between Canada and the United States known as the Columbia River Treaty to guide the management of water resources of the Columbia River Basin, provide economic development and help prevent major floods. “Action on the Columbia” was made by the information services of British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority to convey the benefits and effects of the Columbia River Treaty to the people of British Columbia. The film features spectacular aerial views of the upper Columbia River before the dams went in. In honor of the 50th anniversary of its signing, BC Hydro permitted BPA to include the film in this collection. The digital transfer was made from an original 16 mm color film print.

Ice Dive at White Star Quarry February 2008 This is a video of Ice Diving at White Star Quarry, a popular Scuba Diving spot in Northwest Ohio. It was taken over the first weekend in February 08. If you are a scuba diver you should check out www.whitestarquarry.com. This place is fantastic, with incredible visibilities and lots to see underwater.     The video was shot under the ice in cold conditions.  The divers are Greg Murphy, Patrix Heschel, the divers from TA dive club in columbus, and Videographer, Rich Synowiec. Tenders were Rod Althaus, Patrix and Dave Gwinn.  It was produced using Windows Movie Maker and I know the sound is all Jacked... even though I paid for the rights to use the music I originally had, the youtube antipiracy software keeps rejecting it.

SkyMotion Video - Newfoundland Canada 2012 SkyMotion Video had the absolute privilege to be part of the 2012 crew for the Newfoundland and Labrador Tourism commercial. To be clear, this video is NOT the Newfoundland and Labrador Tourism commercial, but rather a collection of some of our favorite shots from the shoot which made use of SkyMotion Video's unique remote-contolled heli-cam technology.  The most challenging part of the shoot was definitely the sequence with the two characters in the boat. To accomplish these pre-dawn shots out in open water, the team had to operate from a second boat which followed. A special 8' x 8' landing pad was constructed at the back end of the vessel, and from here the team had to take off, fly out to get the shots, and then land - all while moving along the coast-line. Despite the back and forth movement, the tight landing space, and the need to continually match boat speeds, the maneuvers went extremely smoothly, and the results surely speak for themselves.  SkyMotion Video is a Canadian based video company specializing in low altitude aerial cinematography, and photography, using state-of-the-art remote-controlled helicopter (or multicopter drone) technologies. The team provides service locally in Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, and travels throughout Canada and around the world to offer the very best in aerial video services.

He Biked His Sculpture Through Yellowknife's Midnight Sun Have you ever just wanted to get on a bike and ride far away? That's what landscape architect Robert Cram did on his way to The Banff Centre. He biked from Yellowknife to Banff, carrying his art piece, "A Combination of Common Causes." Each time he stopped, he set it up and documented its deterioration in the different landscapes he encountered along the way. The result is haunting and beautiful.  Robert Cram was a participant in the Visual + Digital Arts residency Blueprint for Happiness in 2015.   http://www.rmcram.com/  Follow the Banff Centre: Website: https://banffcentre.ca Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheBanffCentre Twitter: https://twitter.com/thebanffcentre iTunes: http://apple.co/1A2DMmx SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/banff-centre-radio ['Banff (City/Town/Village)', 'Banff Centre (Venue)', 'Yellowknife (City/Town/Village)', 'Cycling (Interest)', 'bike', 'Sculpture (Visual Art Form)', 'Robert Cram', 'Landscape Architecture (Industry)', 'Landscape Architect (Profession)', 'Canada (Country)', 'Landscape Art (Art Period/Movement)', 'Mountain', 'Ride', 'Bicycle (Product Category)', 'Biking']
Amazing Insect Defies Freezing Temperatures! This is a species of wingless crane fly Chionea that can be seen during the winter at about 32F or 0 C.  I found this crane fly in a ski track in Banff National Park. The insect has a natural "anti-freeze like substance in its systm to avoid freezing, which is why it walks so slowly.  If it is jolted or disturbed, it will "freeze" up.

River Run Aug14 2016 A local tubing adventure in Port Alberni BC. It takes about 4hrs with a few stops for breaks and soak in the scenery from the Rifle range to Paper mill dam. It can also be started at the bottom of the Stamp Falls Provincial park. This is about 5hrs with stops. My advice is to get truck inner tubes as they are more durable and will not puncture from a small bump against a stick or sharp rock. bring Water to drink as you may not want to drink the river water. If you bring beverages of a different nature please take your empties with you. a small mesh bag to tie to your tube works to collect the cans. The kids walk on the bottom so please no glass containers. This is our first time bringing the kids. We have done this run at least 50 times probably more and it never gets old. Hope you enjoy.

Digital data logging multimeter Wavetek model 52 Just a short overview of the Wavetek model 52 digital data logging multimeter.  This is a great digital multimeter with a resolution of 32000 counts it has a 1200 data memory and RS232 port for downloading the data to a computer. There is an additional serial port that can be used to multiplex the input of channel one to 64 voltage channels. This uses a 8bit microprocessor (HD63) ruining at 4.91Mhz has a lot of futures including 99 programmable math channels has an LCD display and only uses under 500mW of power when running but the most impressive is the fact that it was build in 1987 so about 25 years ago if you read this in the year this video was uploaded.  If you like to see video reviews about multimeters you can watch Martin Lorton's youtube channel http://www.youtube.com/user/mjlorton ['Data', 'aquisition', 'logging', 'digital', 'multimeter', 'Wavetek', 'model', '51', '52', 'HD63', '8bit', 'microprocessor', 'DDM']

Buster Needs a Wheelchair.wmv Adorable rescue Dachshund with a spinal chord injury needs a wheelchair. http://www.prairieanimalassistance.com/ is a registered charity helping special needs rescue animals.  Please help us raise the money to get Buster a wheelchair. Buster has temporarily borrowed a wheelchair from another dog, but it doesn't quite fit him. It rubs his skin raw even through padded straps and his back end is up too high in the air, putting pressure on his neck and spine. Still, Buster is thankful to have the use of the loaner chair because it is much better than having to drag his back end everywhere.   Buster has a wonderful temperament and is in training to be a therapy dog! His love of life and never-give-up attitude bring a smile to the face of everyone who meets him.  Can you imagine how spending time with Buster could raise the spirits of someone with a newly acquired spinal chord injury? Imagine a child having to go through boring and painful physical therapy and how much more fun it would be with Buster's help.  Buster would love to "pay it foward" and help others, but right now...he needs help.  Can you make a donation and help him get the wheelchair he needs? www.PrairieAnimalAssistance.com  This video shows Buster in his borrowed wheelchair during his first training session at the rehab hospital where he will someday be a therapy dog.  Using clicker training, Buster is learning to pay attention, walk and a loose leash and most importantly for a dog on wheels, to stop. Sorry for the sometimes wiggly video, the person holding the camera was also holding another one of our program dogs.

Bow River: Irrigation and Food Episode Seven -- Proof that fresh food for urban and rural residents alike does not come on a truck from California.    Water is the lifeblood of southern Alberta and the Bow River is critical to the health of the Region.    This educational series of vignettes, shot in spectacular High Definition, takes the viewer on a journey of Water Stewardship of the Bow River and how that stewardship affects life in the Bow Basin.    Designed for both students and general audiences, the series looks at the importance of irrigation to life in Southern Alberta.   In fact, irrigation feeds 40% of the world's population, and not insignificantly in the Bow Basin.  Not many of us know the rich history of irrigation in Alberta and how appropriate stewardship of the finite resources of the Bow River continue to benefit all of us -- both urban and rural residents.      From food production to ecological protection to recreational opportunities, the series paints a fascinating and not-well-understood story of the real Bow River -- not only it's beauty, but its enduring qualities to sustain life, and of the people whose job it is to keep it that way.

Jerusalem Rocks This is a piece shot on location near my home town of Sweetgrass MT. The song was written in March 2012, Soundtrack recording was mostly completed and video production started in late June 2012, Total production time was just about 10 months. Camera is a Canon GL2. Camera operators are myself and my wife Diana Marshall.  Little Jerusalem or the Jerusalem Rocks as they are known are an amazing formation of turrets and rimrocks that have stood for countless years. It's an awesome place that feels like sacred ground somehow. This is the second posting of this video - the one posted 12/21 didn't have sufficient audio gain, so I tried it again with a little more soundtrack. I hope you enjoy this video.

Parmenters Bears Part 1 Adorable, funny and sometimes scarey bear film, all captured in Parmenter's Field, Rosswood BC, in the Great Bear Rainforest.   Dedicated to Don and Louise Parmenter, who built and maintained the famous bear field, where you can find black and brown bears grazing, frolicking, sleeping and playing every May and June.  I felt safe to hang out right amongst the bears, sometimes 5 or 6 at a times, mostly alone, after Don assured me by saying; In thirty one years, I never had a problem with the bears.   It was my great pleasure to not only film some amazing bear scenes, but also to film Don and Louise's old stories of how they came to Rosswood, how they built the bear field and how they built the famous Pee Tree or Water Tree as they prefer to call it. But most the locals just call it The Tree, which has the best water in the world pouring out of it.    Rosswood is 37 km north of Terrace BC, on the Nisga'a Highway 113. Terrace is home of the famous White Kermode Spirit Bear, which is another film.    You can be guaranteed to see bears in Parmenter's Field, every spring. The bears are treated with love and respect. The bears in turn, treat us with respect. Thank you Don and Louise for your amazing grace, dignity and support.  I hope you all enjoy Parmenter's Bears as much as I enjoyed filming it.

Castle Hill National Historic Site, Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull) Last summer, after leaving Cape St. Mary's, we headed to Placentia to check out Castle Hill National Historic Site. The hill has the remnants of English and French fortifications from the 17th and 18th centuries. Many a battle was waged over this strategic piece of high ground. We took in the visitor center first and then headed to the castle. The day was perfect for taking in the easy hiking trails around the hill. We used the headsets available at the visitor's center to learn more about the history as we walked around. Castle Hill is definitely worth the stop if you are in the Placentia Bay area.
