Rocky Mountain high this ain't, but it's close.  Up in the mountains of British Columbia there are many lakes and lodges catering to campers and fishermen. 
Predominantly the fish of choice is the rainbow or Kamloops trout, colorful and good eating, they are relatively easy to catch. Fly fishing, trolling or just fishing with bait like worms can be productive.

http://www.mikehurl.com - Ice Fishing On Lake Erie. This was our second fishing trip of the year without much luck at all! No one in the entire bay reported catching anything. The only thing we did see were mud puppies on the bottom and some actually surfaced through the wholes in the ice.So if your looking for Ice Fishing On Lake Erie. Grangers ICe Fishing out of St Williams Ontario is a good outfitter.
 So from what the guide told me is the best Ice Fishing On Lake Erie is the first few weeks the ice is in or the last week before the huts come off. So book your Ice Fishing On Lake Erie trip around those dates for better fishing.

When doing a lot of deep fishing in rough water, it's nice to be able to have all the gear you might need with you but also a bit of space to maneuver around it all. Italo introduces the Seabreeze Boats, which have been modified to give you considerable leg room when out on the water. These boats are great when fishing for salmon or trout in deep water.

Here is my home made boat loader system. In this video I show it operating (both loading & unloading)  I created this system because my boat, a Lund WC12, weighs in at 205 pounds.  Much too heavy for me to heave up on a truck rack by myself.  I used an ATV winch welded to some square tube steel into my front receiver hitch.  This allows me go camping with my toys!  I also carry my dirt bike on the front of the truck on a motorcycle carrier.   I created this because the fully automatic boat loaders cost $3000 or more and my system came in just over $500.

DescriptionThe ONE and ONLY Model Ship Bluenose II (2006) on YouTube
This is my second Bluenose model (I used the first, a smaller-scale Bluenose I, as a sort of "trial run"), completed in early 2006. The kit, by Bateaux Leclerc, reproduces the original Bluenose II ship (1963), which differs from the contemporary ship we know today. My current project is another Bluenose II model on the same scale, but in the more contemporary version (see my video "At the Helm of Bluenose II in 2006"). I expect to complete it sometime in 2009. Oups... make that 2010!
--------------------------------------------
Après un rodage effectué avec un petit modèle du Bluenose I, j'ai complété ce Bluenose II au début de 2006. Le kit, signé Bateaux Leclerc, reproduit le navire original de 1963, qui diffère du voilier que nous connaissons aujourd'hui. Mon projet actuel, que je compte achever en 2010, est un autre modèle du Bluenose II selon la même échelle, mais qui reproduira le navire dans sa version contemporaine (voir ma vidéo intitulée «At the Helm of Bluenose II in 2006»).Wigwam Resort Presents:  How to Clean a Walleye with Tom Briggs

P7A4P4. in the late 1970's Currant River lost its only hardware store, so to fill that huge gap I started stocking many hardware product, electrical products in both DC and AC, plumbing, computers, electronics, Marine parts for all makes and models of I/O and outboards from Sierra and many other marine brands, as well as marine repairs, small engine repairs, we sell and install trailer hitch's, 5th Wheel Hitch's, trailer repairs, automotive oil changes, servicing and minor repairs, the list keeps going, right into U-Haul rentals, U-Haul used truck sales, U-Haul U-box storage  and so much more, so to better cover all this and much more, I thought I would do many live video's to show off all our products, service, so you the end consumer can get a much deeper insight to everything we have to offer you. This is a huge under taking, and can not be all covered in one or 2 videos, so this will  be a series of live video's to comeFreshwater Fishing Holidays - Travel Alberta, Canada

The "Pond" is know for it's beautiful location nestled into a valley in the rolling rocky bluffs. This is a favorite spot for anglers and has some very nice trout and is a salmon spawning area.

The pond is especially beautiful in the early morning, when the water is like a mirror, but is beautiful any time of day or year.

Welcome to today's fish cooking episode of Thundermist Fishing Tips. Today we're going to be BBQ'ing some delicious tautogs.

Check out the catching Tautog video here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5gexGEOO9o

Antonio, the boatless angler himself, shares with us his recipe. He makes a quick and easy marinade which only needs to rest with the fish for about two hours before cooking.

The big issue when it comes to BBQ'ing fish is that the fillet tends to stick to the grill. The secret to that is to simply leave the skin and scales on. If you descale it, the skin still tends to get stuck to the grill. The best way to prevent your tautog fillet from sticking to the BBQ is to leave the scales on. This applies to other fish as well! There are other methods of course, like tin-foil, or other purchasable ways, but we find that simply leaving the skin and scales on is the simplest method when it comes to barbecuing fish.

For this marinade, it's simple and you don't need to be precise. First you start with a generous amount of olive oil in a plastic bag. Add one full lemon, squeezed, pits and all. We also added some paprika, simple onion powder (just some, you don't want to over do this part), garlic powder (again, just a bit to taste. You can overdo this as well). Mix them all right into the bag along with a bit of black pepper. And that's it!

Next add all the fillets into the bag, the fillets with the skin and scales. Close the bag, and mix them all together. Take out any additional air from the bag, re-seal, and let it rest in the fridge.

The longer you let the fish marinade, the better. But for today we only let the tautog marinade for 2 hours. Overnight in the fridge is a great suggestion as well.

The grill is preheated to 400 degrees F. We want to char the bottom of the fillet along the skin and scales. There's no need to flip the fish, and the whole cooking process usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish with the lid closed.

Don't forget to pour the extra marinade over the fish to get all the flavour.

We did not add salt to the marinade, the best way is to salt the fish while it is on the grill, or even on the table when about to be severed.

You can tell when the fillets are ready as the fillets will start to crack and flake apart. Taking the fish off of the grid should be much easier now with the skin and scales on.

This recipe works not only on Tautog, but on any non-frozen fish as well!

The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of the mining town of Frank, Northwest Territories,[nb 1] Canada, on the morning of April 29, 1903. It occurred at 4:10 am, when over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of limestone rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble.  

For those that are thinking this is in Alberta, you are of course correct,  but in 1903 it was still considered The North West Territories until it was changed  and we officially became the Province of Alberta in 1905.

https://www.youtube.com/user/thundermistluresHow to Cook Mackerel and Bluefish - Easy with No Fishy Taste
We are back in the kitchen again, and do I ever have a recipe for you!

This recipe is for any fish that tastes overly fishy. for example mackerel or bluefish. This recipe takes all the fishiness out of the fish while leaving you with an amazing dish!

It's easy to do, as with all our recipes, and it takes basic ingredients which you most likely already have in your kitchen. Here's what it takes:

Ingredients
- 3 TBS olive oil
- diced tomatoes
- chili pepper
- oregano
- salt and pepper
- 2 onions, thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

And that's it!

First you'll want to slice up your two onions and your two cloves of garlic. I like to slice them very thin, as they tend to cook up nicer this way. That's it for the prep!

Next you'll want to take your three tablespoons of olive oil and add it to your pan. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and lightly fry the onions and garlic for about 2-3 minutes. This way the olive oil can absorb the flavour from the onion and garlic.

Next, take your diced tomatoes and pour them into the pan with the already cooking oil, onions, and garlic mixture. This is where you'll want to add your salt, pepper, and oregano. Basically what you're doing is seasoning your tomatoes.

You'll want to use about a teaspoon of salt and as much black pepper and oregano to taste. If you want, you can add chili pepper to the mix. I like to add that bit of heat.

Now with this mix, we're going to stir everything together and let it simmer over medium to medium high, for about 10 to 15 minutes, just enough to make sure everything is all cooked together.

After the 10/15 minutes, you can add any type of fish you'd like. I suggest using a fish that is stronger or fishy tasting like mackerel or bluefish. You'll be amazed how great they taste! Cut your fish fillets into halves and add them to the mix. You can add them whole if you'd like. This works well with whole fillets, half fillets, or even a whole mackerel!

Make sure you mix the fish up with the tomatoes and get everything all simmering together. Cook the fish for about 10 to 15 minutes depending how high you have the heat. You'll want to keep them simmering.

You'll know when the mackerel or bluefish is done, when the fish fillets starts to break apart a bit.

The last step, is to enjoy!

I wanted to get a video up long ago, this is our first on water test of our new fishing yaks.
I purchased the Ascend D10T kayak from Bass Pro in Alberta for $499 new, Its 10" long & 34" wide, it's very stable with an awesome fishing platform. Bishopp added a beach chair to improve comfort. :) 
Bishopp "Tha Prophet" purchased the new Pelican Catch 120 for $900 new in Sask, it's 11' 8" long & 34" wide, it features a 2 position adjustable seat with a great fishing platform as well. Both are a great budget kayak that are extremely stable, honestly they can compete with the larger price tag yaks.NSLC Adopt-a-Stream "Colin / Digger Log"

Video URL: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zrhrnTuEIISask Yak Fishing - Pelican Catch 120 finally  hits the water
Finally after a long wait, it's time to test our new Kayaks
With our tight budget we did great!
I purchased the Pelican Catch 120 from Canadian Tire, it's 11' 8" long and 34" wide, I'm 6' 2" and a  big guy and this yak has room to spare as well as it sits high on the way and remains extremely stable. LOVE IT!!!! 
Venus "Sask Angler" Purchased the Ascend D10T from Bass Pro in Alberta, it's 10' Long & 34" wide, she's mid 5' and has tons of room left, it's extremely stable as well. 
Both yaks are perfect fishing vessels, crazy stable, agile and fairly quick for their width.

Verdict: The Catch 120 is the best pelican yak I have ever used, I'm very impressed with it's quality, performance and layout. As for the Ascend D10T, this kayak is also very impressive for quality, performance and space for a 10' yak, it should have been bass pro's first 10' sit on fishing yak. If you're on a tight budget consider either of these 2 yaks, you won't be disappointed.

A poor duck near the marina in St. Mary's River, in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, with a fishing lure caught in its foot. The hook seems to be through the web of the left foot. The duck was dragging that foot a bit, but it didn't seem to trouble it too much in the water. Probably a different story on land, though...

Our 2010 summer promotional video showcasing our heli hiking, heli fishing and grizzly bear tours and adventures. We are proud as of 2011 our Grizzly Bear Tours and Grizzly bear Viewing has been recognized by the Canadian Tourism Commission and included in their prestigious "Signature Experiences Collection" which highlights once-in-a-lifetime authentic Canadian experiences!

The historic Tweedsmuir Park Lodge, set on 60 acres of private land within the vast wilderness of British Columbia's largest protected park, is the ideal setting for your wilderness adventures and experiences. Originally built in 1929 as a hunting and fishing lodge, today the lodge accommodates those seeking out a more eco-friendly adventure as well as a relaxing refuge from the pressures of modern life.

The surrounding environment is stunning. Rising above the valley floor are the majestic Coast Mountains, to the west is the largest fjord system in the Americas, and to the east the high Chilcotin Plateau. It is a bio-diverse and spectacular wilderness, home to the totemic wildlife of the Great Bear Rainforest.

Our lodge borders the Atnarko River and in the fall the Grizzly Bears come down to feast on the spawning Salmon. We are smack in the middle of what is one of the healthiest bear habitats in the world and often the bears can be seen wandering past the lodge. Sometimes we even catch them napping on the lawn.

All accommodation at the Tweedsmuir Park Lodge is in one of ten private chalets with the main lodge providing lots of common space for dining, games, and socializing. It is perfect set up for family reunions and corporate groups, which can book the full premises, yet intimate enough that the individual traveler and smaller groups will feel at home. The focus throughout is on great service, and an authentic, welcoming Canadian hospitality.

Although the lodge and the entire Bella Coola Valley are geographically remote, it is nevertheless easy and convenient to make your way to our door step.

At Tweedsmuir Park Lodge we are lucky to live in a stunning and pristine environment and have a wonderful community supporting us. We are committed to keeping it that way and ask all our guests to participate in our environmental stewardship initiatives to ensure that Bella Coola continues to be the most extraordinary place in the world to enjoy the great outdoors.

We were on a fly in fishing trip to Abamasagi lake ontario when the unexpected happened.  I have read about this from the thickest books and have only seen 1 photo in a friends cabin, it is rarer sight then a Minnesota Vikings winning super bowl trophy, I know that is rare being from Minnesota.  

If my father and I had not fished this point the night before the walleye would have been so thick that this would not have been possible.  

A swimming grey wolf...  #do not get me too close.  #Awesome Possum, Holy Cow.

It has been over ten years since I fished Mike Lake and it is the lake where I cut my teeth as an angler.  Hope You Enjoy!Chilko Lake Lodge: Go Wild!

Home to the spirit bear, grizzly bear, black bear, wolves, humpback whales, orcas, dolphins, seals, sea otters, river otters, and lots more. It is truly the Amazon of the North. What is so terrible is Canada has a projected plan to ship oil through this waters via 1000 foot oil takers through less than 2 km wide channels. Up in these waters are some of the biggest tides on the Pacific Coast and it would be complete and utterly chaotic. SAY NO TO ENBRIDGE!!!! ENJOY.Vlog 001: Manliest Bachelor's Party Day 01

MLS Description:
When I first drove up to this divine property I was intrigued by its unique location, and the fact that it had so many mature trees -- a rare find in PEI. Also the fact that it is a prestigious corner lot that faces a year round primary road on one side, and a clay road on the other. The best part; a short walk down the road is a fabulous beach, and miles of sand to explore in either direction in almost complete privacy and seclusion. The lot also sits on a hill which grants the new owner some amazing 360 degree panoramic views of the ocean, beaches, and the surrounding rolling hills. This extra large lot or acreage could be completely customized for your new dream home with a view. All for a very low price.
Located near Evangeline Region, Maximeville, Cap-Egmont, Abram Village, Urbainville, Wellington, St. Raphael, Mont Carmel, Richmond, Egmont Bay, Union Corner, Union Corner Provincial Park, and St. Nicholas.

Rock Island Lighthouse is located in the Thousand Islands about 4.5 miles northeast of Clayton, Jefferson County, New York, off of Fisher's Landing. Originally commissioned in 1847, it is one of six lights put up along the St. Lawrence River to guide traffic to and from Lake Ontario through the waterway. The Rock Island station is the best preserved, as all of its structures still survive. It was refitted in 1855, rebuilt in 1882, and moved in 1903. The light was closed in 1955 after more a century of service.  In June 2013, the island and all its buildings were  reopened to the public as a park maintained by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation & Historic Preservation.  The island is accessible by private boat and local shuttle service, and the grounds are open for touring and picnicking. www.rockislandlighthouse.org

This early 8mm film was discovered in the basement of the Denbigh Community Hall around 2001 during some 'spring cleaning'. It was digitized and used as a fund raiser for the Addington Highlands Public Libraries.

The video was filmed by Mr. Bill Scott (now deceased) - owner of Scott's Shopping Centre at the base of Eagle Hill (Ashby Lake Road).  Bill had the foresight to video record many community activities during the 1967 Centennial year in Denbigh.

The entire film is 31 minutes long and starts with the New Year's Eve Dance followed by the Ski-doo Races on Denbigh Lake displayed above with the dance afterwards.  

Other activities in the full version include Track & Field, Parades, Fishing Derby, Winter Carnival, Maple Syrup Festival and Old Home Week.  

A 3 minute sampler of this film is on the CDHS Flickr page:

Temagami offers many varieties of fish, including Lake Trout, Pickerel, Small-mouth Bass, Pike, and Whitefish.  Some area lakes even support Rainbow or Speckle Trout angling.  

For the more adventurous campers who want to leave civilization behind, the Temagami region contains over 8,000 square kilometres of interconnecting canoe routes.  Hundreds of rock and pine clad lakes, adjoining wetlands, and wild rivers provide breathtaking scenery and a wide diversity of wildlife.  The unique and varied features of the Temagami area have been recognized in the establishment of several waterway and wilderness provincial parks, and continues to be a favourite area for canoe tripping.

Temagami is the reality that fuels the popular perception of Canada's great North land, with old growth pine forests; smooth blue waters; brilliantly white, powdery snow; and bountiful fish and wildlife.

Temagami is steeped in history. Some of the world's oldest rock has surfaced here, and has been scraped and smoothed by centuries of glaciation. Artifacts and stone drawings dating as far back 6000 B.C. have been discovered here. Grey Owl, the mysterious naturalist who captured the world's imagination back in the 1930s, has become a part of the Temagami landscape. Over the centuries, people have been drawn to the area as if by a magnet. Temagami is truly a place of mystical magic, an adventurer's mecca.

Temagami has been a renowned centre for outdoor and wilderness recreation for over 100 years.Steve Phillips Productions: "The Road Not Taken", Alaska/Yukon Documentary (Episode Six of Eight)

Located in Haliburton County, just 2 1/2 hours north of Toronto, Nine Lakes is a pristine reserve of just under 7000 acres of forest, lakes and rivers. Divided into nine parcels, each with its own lake, this rugged, unspoiled wilderness awaits your adventurous spirit. First explored by pioneer loggers pushing up from the Ottawa valley in the early 1800’s much of the Haliburton area is now protected and preserved as a wildlife sanctuary. 

A mix of coniferous trees, maple forests and spruce bogs, Nine Lakes is alive with white tail deer, black bear, beaver, wolves, moose and dazzling mix of bird species including Indigo Buntings, Boreal Chickadees, Grey Jays and Spruce Grouse. The rivers and lakes teem with Trout, Muskie, Walleye and Northern Pike providing outstanding fishing.

Nine Lakes, whether it’s a corporate retreat in a private piece of Canadian Wilderness at its very best, a quiet long term family investment with that idyllic lakeside home you’re always dreamed of, or as a whole parcel with significant development potential, the Nine Lakes adventure awaits your touch.Prince Edward Island Real Estate PEI Marketing Update Realtor Agent June 2013 Social Media

This movie have been filmed at the beautiful Kahnawake quarry near Montreal QC Canada in september 2011. I think that this setup performed amazingly! the only drawback that i found is the battery life compare to my old Canon SD780-IS.

 Note : The vigneting in the corners is only due because i did not place the wide angle len sun shield as it sould be, i fixed the problem at the end of the movie as you can see.Fishing Boat Dragged by an Excavator in Harbourville, NS

If you are thinking about taking a trip to Presque Isle State Park, or want to remember what it looks like from a past visit, this is a video of what it looks like to drive around the park.  There is a main loop that first goes along the shore of Presque Isle Bay, turns around near the tip of the peninsula, and then travels along the shore facing Lake Erie.  Although there are several places that were not explored, this is a drive on the main road with two popular side-roads (near the beaches facing Lake Erie).

Clearwater Lake Lodge was originally started in 1915 by Charlie and Petra Boostrom. They chose the west end of Clearwater Lake because they believed that views of the palisades were the best on the Gunflint Trail. The main lodge was finished in 1926 and had 14 rooms. They owned and operated the lodge till 1946 when they sold it for $45,000. It has had several owners since then and is now owned by Carl Clark and Adam Van Tassell. The Van Tassell family lives on site and are the full time caretakers of the property. The lodge is the oldest and largest free standing hand-hewn whole log structure in the region and is listed on the National Historic Registry. Clearwater Lodge has been in the resort and outfitting business since 1915 and is the oldest resort on the Gunflint Trail and the original outfitter of the area.Ocean Memories

Wood River Expedition Episode 1: Sunwapta Falls to Athabasca Crossing
The plan was to accomplish the first descent of the remote Wood River in British Columbia by hiking into 24km from Sunwapta Falls into it's headwaters at Fortress Lake, paddling 15km across the lake, 30 km down the river (excluding 2 major class VI waterfall filled canyons) then ascending back up 3500 ft in 37 km to the continental divide though Athabasca pass, crossing into Alberta again and navigating the Whirlpool River the remaining 80 km back to the Icefield Parkway. 

Turns out there is a reason no one has ever done this before. Luke Schmidt punctured his raft, we did some canyon swimming,ended up losing both boats (and my paddle) in a gorge. This necessitated some severe bushwhacking and spending some chilly nights on the mountainside, but in the end we completed this 5 day trip in a mere 11 days :). 

In this episode we eat wild strawberries, do some hiking, get wet, try out my new Ultralight Tipi Tent by Seek Outside (the BT-2) and do some fishing in the most beautiful little lake you'll ever see.Culverson Lake Outpost

Episode 18 Jim McIsaac
BC Commercial Fishing Caucus

This week’s Conversation that Matters features Jim McIsaac of the BC Commercial Fishing Caucus.

McIsaac says, since the restructuring of the commercial fishing industry in the 90’s communities up and down the coast have been disenfranchised from the sector that was their lifeblood. He says, it comes at a time when fish stocks are well managed and robust. McIsaac points out fishing is a fraction of its former size.

Here are some pics & video I took today of another part of Alberta.  Ram River Country.  We got rained out of our campsite.Did The YAMAHA ATV's Grizzly And Kodiak See A Nessie At Ingall Falls? lol - Oct.20 2012
Today's adventure takes us out exploring down the Dore Lake - Ingall Falls area.
Was a pretty nice day out for this time of year! We come across some "Nessie" type creature swimming around in the lake below Ingall Falls. Pretty sure it was an Otter, but who am I to say? hahaha
Quite a beautiful area down there. Lots of camping spots and lakes, creeks, rivers, water-falls, you name it! We are pretty lucky to have such a great area to ride!
Buckle up you helmet and enjoy the ride!

Cubbeezx is about Cubbee and CK's  everyday real life ATV Moto Vlogging X'LeNt Adventures.

Our regular quad rides are a 2011 Yamaha Grizzly 700 EPS and a 2011 Yamaha Kodiak 450 SE EPS.  On weekends, we usually can be found exploring the back woods of North Western Ontario on wheels or tracks.

First ride of the season without the tracks on the Yamaha Grizzly 700! Unfortunately, it poured rain the whole weekend. We weren't going to let that stop us. Cubbee had not done a wheelie in like 8 or 9 months and was starting to have withdrawals! lol
Did the Gilbert Lake loop trail, it was awesome. A herd of black bears ran across the trail in front of us. At first we thought there were three big ones, but I think there may have been four!!
On the way home we came across the smallest baby deer we have ever seen. It was trying to cross the highway with it's mom. We waited for it and it turned around and hit in the ditch, so we managed to get a quick picture of it.

Out for a Sunday quad ride on the Yamaha 700 Grizzly and Kodiak 450 atv's to Burr Lake. I think it was about a year or two ago we had gone through this trail. Lots of beaver dams to cross, but nothing too bad. Not sure why, but the water levels in Burr Lake were down about 3 feet. Maybe a beaver dam let go down stream or something?

In this video we bake "Ihatchetjack's" bread recipe in a outback oven.  Then we attempt to bake pizza.  That is when Mother Nature takes over the show.  This video was shot in the beautiful Parc régional du Poisson Blanc, Quebec during the 2010 Econo Challenge.

Pizza Recipe:
Crust -- plain rice cake
Sauce -- Hot sauce packets from Toco Bell X 2
Pepperoni -- Sliced meat stick
Cheese -- Extra old cheddar
Bake in outback oven for 45 minutes.  Give or take a rain storm or two.
(Note that heavy rain will turn your pizza into a soggy mess in seconds.)

Mt. Polly has shown us two things:
1 - The Government doesn't give a Rats Ass about anything but profit
2 - We are going to pay for it all... again... and that won't do a thing
Right here http://youtu.be/iR2aN-9au2E we have quick clips on the Propaganda, irresponsibility, and outrageous behavior of our own government as we cover;

- The Fallout from the incredible Tailings Pond spill at Mt. Polly
- The Impact on the fisheries and local life
- The Christy Clark Spin Machine in three parts...
- (Christy is so full of it... just gotta say that)
- The Mining spokesperson so well paid to spin into profit

Yup, it's business as usual for a corrupt and inept government and the nonsense machine we call lame-stream media.  And we have a whole section coming up showing you the truth they're ignoring.

It's Video Radio - doing our best to fight the Fascism, and win the war with logic, a sense of humour, and facts that Lame-Stream just can't handle.

More to come - thanks for staying tuned!


Cheers!

Be the change you wish to see in the worldGeocaching in Nipigon
Every Labour Day weekend, a pair of geocachers from Nipigon organize a cache hunt to coincide with the Nipigon Fall Fishing Festival. Geocachers from all over North Western Ontario descend upon the community for caching and fun.

This year, we went again, and I took my two year old son for a hike up to The Bald Spot to find a couple geocaches. I wasn't quite sure what to expect for the trail up there, or the difficulty of the climb. The trail and geocache were very nice, but I was mostly impressed by my son who did the hike all by himself.

It was a beautiful fall morning, the leaves were just starting to change colour, and it smelled wonderful. We had a great hike and geocache hunt, and I wanted to save the memory with this video.Big East Lake Day One

We're pretty serious about our fishing, but when you're on an island for 4 months, you've got to have a little fun.  Here's some quick clips of a few great guests from Illinois and Arizona, as well as our staff from the past couple of days.  FYI, the guitar playing was at 10:30pm...Music Video #1 (Sweet Potato Fly)
The first in a series of videos for my original music, this song seemed like an appropriate starting point.  I used images and video clips from my last family fishing trip to Campbellford, Ontario, including beautiful landscapes and some great footage of my brother Mike catching a nice musky.  Using a slow zoom in/out on the still images made several of them appear as if the water is actually rippling.  My goal was to use simple editing techniques and processes to produce a dreamy atmosphere.FRCN Indigenous Foods Course UW 2016

Video documentary information and disclaimer follows.

The video content was obtained on Treaty 5 Territory at Fisher River Cree Nation (FRCN) Manitoba in 2016.

Video of an automata project depicting a young boy fishing from a cottage dock on a warm summer day. He has his dog with him who excitedly looks into the water for fish. Two seagulls loiter nearby hoping to get some sort of tidbit. Under the dock lurks a largemouth bass, apparently uninterested in the bait. A catfish rests deep in the shadows and a crayfish moves in and out from his lair in some rocks. Unnoticed by the boy s little fish anxiously jumps at the bait just as the line is lifted and misses.

Imagine approaching a shoreline to explore, at the push of a button once more Sealegs Amphibious capablities spring into action by lowering 3 wheels much like an aircraft landing gear does! Imagine again, driving up onto land from the water to explore, camp or have a waterside lunch!  Time to go home, drive your Sealegs Amphibious Boat with its patented amphibious technology back into the water, raise the wheels and power up the boat. It's that simple - with "less hassle and a lot more fun"!

Voici quelques moments de pêche de cette saison 2012 au Lac Saint Pierre, Québec, Canada. Une saison inoubliable...

Le lac Saint-Pierre constitue en réalité un élargissement du Saint Laurent. Il se divise en plusieurs bras à Sorel, découpant ainsi les îles du Lac. Ces différents bras se rejoignent alors pour former le lac, puis le fleuve reprend sa morphologie au niveau de Trois-rivières.
Classé réserve mondiale de la biosphère, le lac Saint Pierre et ses îles affirment donc leur grande richesse : plus de 70 espèces de poissons, dont 8 sportives : carpe, esturgeon jaune, achigan petite et grande bouche (bass et black bass), dorés jaunes et noirs (sandres), maskinongé & brochet. 

La Pourvoirie du Lac Saint Pierre se situe au coeur des îles, lui offrant un incroyable territoire de jeu, capable de ravir n'importe quel pêcheur : que vous soyez un inconditionnel du carnassier et des pêches actives ou bien désireux de piquer quelques belles communes vierges sur des spots sauvages lors de sessions mémorables, cette destination est faite pour vous...Osez l'aventure et affrontez le Saint Laurent!

http://www.ctvvancouverisland.ca
http://www.facebook.com/ctvvi

Port Alberni - A pair of amazing fish tales are making the rounds on the west coast of Vancouver Island after two groups of anglers caught some breathtaking close encounters with whales.

Shirley Antonelli and her husband were fishing near the Broken Group Islands off the coast of Ucluelet on a two day trip on their Double Eagle boat when they got the scare of their life. A gray whale suddenly surfaced inches from the front of their boat, before swimming under the vessel and nearly sending the two anglers into the ocean. 

The entire encounter was caught on tape.

Weeks earlier a fishing charter off the coast of Tofino got a first hand view of a humpback whale breaching. A client on board the boat caught the amazing mother nature show on tape and sent the company the footage.

Dip net fishing in a small pond off the Bras D'or lake in Cape-Breton Nova-Scotia.
All fish were returned to the water alive, NONE were kept or harmed.
- We spotted the small puddle full of Smelts from the road up a hill and ran down the hill with a dip net. There were probably 1000+ fish in the puddle and if we had a dip net with smaller holes you could have gotten a full net every swipe.Boat ride on mister lake going back to Camp Manitou

A few years ago the oldest son and I took a Pearl Jam + Fishing vacation.  We flew to Vancouver and enjoyed the city for a few days, then caught the Vancouver PJ show.  Next morning we flew to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, caught some puddle jumpers, ending-up in  La Ronge, Saskatchewan, 500 miles north of the Canadian border.  At La Ronge, the folks from "Angler Rapids" fishing lodge sent a float plane.  After a half hour flight up the Churchill River we came to Angler Rapids, a rustic yet comfortable lodge in a gorgeous wilderness setting.  September days at Angler Rapids are crisp & clear.  Nights with an autumn moon reflecting off the water and a sky full of stars are impossibly beautiful.  (In other seasons visitors get displays from Aurora Borealis).  But it's the waterway that is truly impressive.  The water here is always churning underneath your boat.  This fast, cold rushing current provides Angler Rapids with some of the best Walleye & Northern Pike fishing we've experienced.  After 3 days of FANTASTIC fishing, cooking our catch outdoors over open wood-fires, we had to make our way back home.  But it was OK, we caught Pearl Jam again, this time in Saskatoon, from the 2nd row, Stone's side of the stage.Tour of Locke Bay on the Winnipeg River Between Kenora and Minaki Ontario

I made this in Y2003 when we fished Robert Lake South. It was my fishing companions first trip north and my third. I've since gone seven times, all with the same outfitter.

I had to split the original video to fit within You Tupe's time confines. It is a total of just over 19 minutes.

This is an exciting compilation of funny, scary, peaceful, amazing, and epic experiences while paddling around Vancouver Island, British Columbia, over the last year.   

Shot in Clayoquot Sound, Broken Group Islands, Gulf Islands, Haida Gwaii, Broughton Archipelago, Surge Narrows, Nuchatlitz, and Kyuquot.   

Watch this video in High Definition ( High-Definition high-def HD) for your best experience.

There are many reasons to sea kayak, and what I show here are just a few of my reasons, ranging from surfing tidal rapids, to watching wildlife.  You can watch Orca ( Killer Whale ), Humpback Whales, Stellar Sea Lions ( sealions ), Pacific Whiteside Dolphins ( White side ), and all the little critters.  Including a Lewis' Moonsnail, Vermillion Starfish, Ochre Star, and more.  Bald Eagles, and Wolves ( wolf ).

Surf tidal rapids at Surge Narrows, paddle in rock gardens in Clayoquot Sound, or surf in Tofino.  

Practice sea kayak rolling using a Greenland Paddle ( Pawtik ).   Crash in an epic collision while surfing.   Paddle along Goletas Channel, paddle in the Broughton.   Sit back and enjoy the campfire.  Kayak fishing, fish for salmon while kayaking.  Cook your fish over camp fire ( campfire ).  Watch the sunset over the Pacific Ocean.

These images have been collected over the last year using mostly a GoPro HD Camera.  Supplementry images collected with a Nikon D70 SLR, Olympus and Sony cameras.

I generally am wearing a Kokatat drysuit or paddle jacket.  In these videos I paddle a Current Design Gulfstream and a Current Design Solstice GTS kayak.   I also paddle using a Werner Kalliste paddle, and an Epic Paddle.

This is an overview video which describes the very unique talents of one Timmy Cudmore who humorously calls himself the "KING FISH MAN"! Timmy hails from the beautiful Prince Edward Island in Canada. He writes and sings songs about one of his greatest passions: TROUT FISHING! Yup, I said fishing.

'"In The Wild" is a TV Show idea inspired by the award-winning professor David Musial from America. It is part of the "NextGen Stars®" series in development which focuses on the "MENTOR' to the "Next Generation of Stars" in any field. Timmy teachers his children and grandchildren how to fish. He teaches us all through zany, musical humor, how fun it can be to fish.

Lot's of source footage has been shot in the past 3 years, including a great deal in the new "Ultra HD" format, so this Crowd Funding venture is designed to enable Professor Musial to employ a team of highly skilled, "directors-to-be", college interns, to assist him in producing a few more shoots & editing shows for potential network or social net distribution.

Timmy has many songs available for sales on iTunes, CD Baby ands more. Please consider supporting this cool mentorship venture by visiting KickStarter.com, and also...

We wanted to share how beautiful it is here in the Fraser Valley.  Our location directly on the Harrison River makes for easy canoe launching, and the water is still running high with snow melt, fed primarily from Harrison Lake and also from the Chehalis River.  Just downstream from us, the blue-green water of the Harrison runs into the mighty, and muddy, Fraser River.

This was shot right at the confluence of the Harrison & Chehalis Rivers. The air, water and mountains here are incredibly clean and beautiful.  If you listen closely, you can hear the birds singing.Boat Testing: 2016 Tahoe Vista QL 2785

Taken July 18 2015. Watch in HD for better viewing.

      
 Cameron Falls  is located within Hidden Lake Territorial Park, on the Ingraham Trail. It is approximately 47 km east of Yellowknife.
      There is a small parking lot with pit toilet facilities, at the start of a 20 minute hike along a well marked trail to Cameron Falls. The falls are worth a visit at all times of the year. In winter the falls are frozen right over. In spring, melt-waters roar under the ice. Water levels in summer have been known to drop low enough to allow walking across the falls above the overhang. And in the fall the changing colours of the leaves are always a good reason to bring along your camera.

ATTRACTIONS & POINTS OF INTEREST:
     It is possible to hike upstream from Cameron Falls to the Cameron River Ramparts Waterfalls, a distance of 8 or 9 km. The trail is not well developed, but the river is relatively easy to follow and the route is obvious.
If you choose to follow the north (far) side of the river, there is a foot bridge at Cameron Falls, which also offers access into the rest of Hidden Lake Park. You will have to re-cross the river at the Ingraham Trail bridge at Cameron River Crossing, a short ways upstream from the Ramparts.
      The park offers access for canoeists to the Lower Cameron River Canoe Route, one of the Ingraham Trail Canoe Routes.- www.NWTParks.ca

Blane Chocklett swings by SO World Headquarters and cooks up his T-Bone musky fly. The T-Bone has a huge profile and a great "kick" that make it perfect for big ambush predators like Musky. More importantly, Blane demonstrates the use of articulated shanks and flex tubing, both of which are really pushing the boundaries of what's possible in fly design. Great stuff Blane!

As we paddled across the province of Alberta on the North Saskatchewan river we were appalled to see so many cows pooping on shore.  This is an illegal practice and yet despite the fact that these farmers have beautiful large homes, great big shiny farm equipment they are allowed to cut corners and pollute our waters.  All this water flows downstream.  The fish population is stressed and the water is so polluted it's disgusting.  Our actions affect others - how these farmers can sleep at night I don't know.  I think it's a shame that some people care more about money than the environment.  I think it's ridiculous that the Albertan authorities allow this continue.  What do you think? We are all stewards of this land - we must all do our part.A Taste of Northern Ontario Canada - early days without a gimbal or good camera

Capilano Coho Salmon Indian Reserve Massacre in North Vancouver British Columbia September 2012. Not saying anything "illegal" was done here. But sometimes you should not do stuff "just because you can, legally speaking". Oh and read this on Wiki about the Indian Band "The Capilano Reserve is the site of major commercial and residential developments, mostly on the West Vancouver side of its area. These include the Park Royal Shopping Centre and associated apartment buildings, and a small office tower adjacent to the intersection of Taylor Way, and a large recreational vehicle park more or less beneath the northern end of the Lions Gate Bridge (the highway interchange for the bridge is also on reserve land).

March 4th, 2017 - Vaughan, Ontario

Woah!!! This isn't a vlog, nor is it a how-to video. Here's us unboxing something we ordered for a while and was so eager to receive it. We checked the mail as quickly as possible everyday, and Wednesday,  March 1st, 2017 at 5pm we received it.

Had to wait until we got together so we could record an unboxing video for you guys. This is our first impressions - We have not seen it at all. Only idea we had about it was the layout on the computer which looks SO different than in RL (RL=Real Life... For those who had no idea but didn't want to ask "stupid" questions).

We tried to keep it short, sweet, and entertaining by adding a dash of fun. See, not all unboxings are boring. 

Don't forget to check out Skollgear (https://skollgear.com) for all sun-protective apparel. They strive to provide you with amazing clothing that'll protect you from the sun while you're out, and to keep you out longer to catch more. ▸ When ordering, let Skoll know we sent you & get a great deal!!

Also, to catch more fish you have to have contact one way or another. Whether it be head-on, the bottom, where ever. Woo! Tungsten gives amazing high quality weights for those flipping and drop shots. More sensitive, to have you feel everything. It's not fishing without any sort of contact. So never forget that "FISHING IS A CONTACT SPORT" and go catch some fish especially equipped with WOO!TUNGSTEN!

Without a doubt, houseboating is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable ways to spend summertime in the Thompson Okanagan.Washington Park, Anacortes, WA, USA
Beautiful views of Guemes Channel and Burrows Bay as seen from Washington Park and also the park's famous leaning tree (one of Washington state's most photographed tree) in the historic town of Anacortes on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County, Washington, USA during our trip on Sep. 3, 2011.

Washington Park is located on a peninsula at the western tip of Fidalgo Island. The 220-acre city park features camping, a boat launch, and day use picnic sites. The park juts into Rosario Strait on the western edge of Anacortes, offering territorial views. A scenic 2.3-mile one-way loop road winds through the park's forested hills and meadows with views of the San Juan Islands and Olympic Mountains. The park offers sweeping views of Guemes Channel on one side and Burrows Bay on the other.

At Sunset Beach, on the north shore, there is a boat launch, restrooms, reservable picnic shelter, playground and open play area. There are 75 campsites, restrooms, showers and laundry services in the overnight area. Picnic sites and car pullouts provide beach access along Green Point, the west shoreline. The loop road is used by cars, joggers, bicyclists and walkers.

Anacortes is the gateway to the San Juan and Vancouver Islands. Downtown Anacortes has over 125 life-sized murals painted by local resident Bill Mitchell. He painted the murals over the last 25 years from historical photographs. His art is on display all over Downtown buildings with depictions of historic scenes. Pick up a free mural map at the Visitor Center located at 819 Commercial Avenue as it is a wonderful way to discover Anacortes.
 
Anacortes is located 18 miles west of Mount Vernon and about one hour drive from Bellingham to the north and Seattle to the south.

Driving directions to the park: From I-5 take Highway 20 West. Enter Anacortes on Spur 20 and take Commercial Avenue to 12th Street. Turn left on 12th and follow the signs (about 3 miles) to Washington Park.

This is the CBC Compass News TV coverage of the house.  
This spectacular architectural gem, located on the North Coast, sits on a bluff facing the awesome expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. Nestled in the natural landscape of 11 acres, this 13,500 sq ft home was designed by a nationally renowned American architect who also oversaw every detail of construction. No expense was spared in the construction of this home from the foundation of reinforced poured concrete to roof of Western red cedar; every effort was made to build a house meant to last generations. The exterior of the house features Cape Cod siding and imported Pennsylvania field stone from Valley Forge Mountain. The stone walls as well as all of the patios are capped in Pennsylvania flag stone, giving the house a natural feel that blends into the surrounding landscape. The windows in the house are all Pella Architectural series windows, all of them custom built for this house. These solid wood windows feature aluminum cladding on the exterior as well as Vivid View screens.
Located near Gulf of St. Lawrence, Atlantic Ocean, Greenwich, Greenwich National Park, Cable Head East, Cable Head West, St. Peters Bay, St. Peters, Red Head, Cable Head, Goose River, Morell, Midgell, Crowbush Golf Course, Crowbush, and Lakeside.

Song Info:
Ron Hynes - No Change In Me
Buddy Wasisname & The Other Fellers - Saltwater JoysReturn to Buckhorn - 1971
This Super 8mm movie was shot in July 1971 at Buckhorn Narrows Campground, in Buckhorn, Ontario.  The location is in the Kawartha Lakes region of Southern Ontario.  Included in this are pictures of Buckhorn Lake, the Gannons Narrows Bridge, the Peterborough Lift Lock, and the tour of the Trent-Severn Canal from a tour boat in Downtown Peterborough, which shows the waterspray near Beavermead the CHEX-TV tower and studio facility; and Trent University where the tour boat turns around, to head back to go through the lift lock, then back to the mooring area downtown in Peterborough.

Also included are film segments of my father and his friend fishing for walleye at Buckhorn Lake, plus a site survey we did of what was to had been future places to go and rent a cabin, boat, etc.  Unfortunately, my father (the white haired gentleman) died in 1976 and we never did go as a family to that part of Ontario after 1972.  

This movie was shot on Super 8 film and thus has NO AUDIO on it.  It is a historical record of my family and my parents friends from 1971, when we would vacation together.

Best of British Columbia Travel - HelloBC!!
Best of British Columbia Travel for me has to be around where I lived so many years ago. The Nicola region has some amazing scenery and we saw none of the garbage and litter that is present in other parts of the province that we just traveled.  The saying is a lake a day as long as you stay and the fishing for rainbow(aka Kamloops) trout can be good.  This is fly-fishing country on small secluded lakes where you might be the only angler.

MLS Description:
This spectacular architectural gem, located on the North Coast, sits on a bluff facing the awesome expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. Nestled in the natural landscape of 11 acres, this 13,500 sq ft home was designed by a nationally renowned American architect who also oversaw every detail of construction. No expense was spared in the construction of this home from the foundation of reinforced poured concrete to roof of Western red cedar; every effort was made to build a house meant to last generations. The exterior of the house features Cape Cod siding and imported Pennsylvania field stone from Valley Forge Mountain. The stone walls as well as all of the patios are capped in Pennsylvania flag stone, giving the house a natural feel that blends into the surrounding landscape. The windows in the house are all Pella Architectural series windows, all of them custom built for this house. These solid wood windows feature aluminum cladding on the exterior as well as Vivid View screens.

A strange, unknown voice appears in the audio portion of this video that was recorded during a fishing trip on Newboro Lake, Ontario Canada. 

Listen to the voice right after "Here comes a nice line of rain." 

The voice seems to say something in a foreign language.  There were three people on the boat at the time, and none of them spoke the strange phrase.

Cubbee leads a group of 5 ATV's to see the old Avenger Airplane crash site, well at least what is left of it.  We were hoping to be able to look for the rock igloo again along the way, but just didn't have enough time. 

 The wreckage is of an Avenger airplane that crashed near Dryden Ontario in 1971 while fighting forest fires. Fortunately the pilot was ok, but had quite a story to tell. 
You can read all about it in an article we found from The Ottawa Citizen at the following link:

http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19710604&id=qccyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ruwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1156,1333027


We did encounter some great, smooth trails though. Nothing too challenging, but some awesome scenery along the way. 

The quads with us that day were a 1000 Arctic Cat Mudpro, a 660 and 700 Yamaha Grizzly, a 550 Polaris Sportsman and a Can-Am XT 1000.

Keep your wheels on the ground..seriously! I am up here at Logan Lake, British Columbia, Canada (just south of Kamloops) to check out some real estate property. With the HUGE cost of property ownership in Vancouver, Logan Lake is looking EXCELLENT!

Logan Lake is a community of about 2,100 people at an elevation of 3,600 feet about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of Kamloops, British Columbia. 

It is a friendly, clean and safe community with perhaps 35% of the people here being retired. 

It is a great secret...until perhaps now! Won't you be my neighbor?  LOL.

Wabagishik Rapids is a beautiful 1 km stretch of rapids on the Vermilion River, about 1/2 hour west of Sudbury, Ontario.

Grizzly bears are the perfect symbol of Canada's untamed wilderness and to see one up close is both awe inspiring and frightening.

Although these majestic animals are found in many parts of Western Canada, one of the best places to observe large numbers of wild grizzlies is in Knight Inlet on the western coast of British Columbia. Every fall, thousands of salmon migrate from the ocean into the Glendale River to spawn and every year large groups of grizzlies gather for a salmon feast like no other.

Tribal Treks takes ordinary people on extraordinary adventures with the First Nations people of Canada.

In This Episode, Ronnie and Graham Gerrard, hairdressers from the city, go to Bamfield, British Columbia, to visit the traditional lands of the Huu-ay-aht First Nation.

Derek Peters welcomes them and gives a tour.  Clifford Charles arranges their campsite at the Pachena Bay Campground where the couple finds a spiritual connection.  Larry Johnson, the Economic Development Manager for the Huu-ay-aht First Nation, takes them fishing and to a traditional salmon feast.  Robert Dennis Junior teaches drumming, Colleen Peters teaches dancing, and Gabe Williams lets them try some carving and then takes them on a canoe paddle in a traditional dugout canoe.Shab Forest Fire

YellowKnife NWT Canada - Driving from DETTAH to Franklin Avenue via Dettah Ice Road. I was told that the ice right now is about 4ft - 5ft and can still support a load of 0 - 40,000kg. February 7 2014. Wacth in HD for better viewing.
------------ Dettah or Detah is a First Nations community in the North Slave Region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Located just outside the capital of Yellowknife, it is a 6.5 km (4.0 mi) drive from that town by ice road in winter or a 27 km (17 mi) drive via the Ingraham Trail. The name means 'Burnt Point' in the Tli Cho language, and refers to a traditional fishing camp, used by the Dene for hundreds of years.
According to the 2011 Census, Dettah had a population of 210 people a decrease of 15.0% from the 2006 Census, consisting almost entirely of First Nations. In 2012 the Government of the Northwest Territories reported that the population was 260 with an average yearly growth rate of 1.9% from 2001.
Both it and N'Dilo are the communities of the Yellowknives. Dettah is represented by the Yellowknives Dene First Nation (Dettah) and are part of the Akaitcho Territory . - www.Wikipedia.com

- Crab limit is 4 per day per person. 
- No killing the crabs or "shelling" onsite, do it at home.
- You are allowed 2 traps per license per person

*I would highly recommend using the cast traps (as seen in the video) for crabbing if you are crabbing off a pier. From all the times, I've seen people with the bigger box crab cages\traps. I have never seen anyone catch anything.Jackson Kayak Kraken Review

Ketchikan Alaska is not only the Salmon Capital of the World it is also the rain capital of the world. Ketchikan is one of the most popular Cruise ship port destinations with a colorful downtown and unique creek street, once Ketchikan's red light district.

Ketchikan is a great place for a fishing charter even if you are only there for the day. Your catch can be cleaned, packed, and shipped home to arrive upon your return your you can surprise family or friends. There's nothing quite like getting fish in the mail.

How did Ketchikan get its name? Its unknown even what it means. Some say it means "This river belongs to Ketch" but others claim Ketchikan refers to a thundering eagle.

People are always asking me how I made these videos with cool FX. If you're interested in how I made this video on my home computer and the software I used here is a link: http://millenniumtrail.com/Video-Editing-Software.htm

Note: This video is an original work created from photos taken on my visit to Ketchikan Alaska on a cruise. I created animations, objects and titles with photo and video editing software.

Chef Alessandro and our team recently visited Haida Gwaii to experience where our 100% certified Ocean Wise seafood is sourced first hand.

We had an amazing time razor clamming with renowned Haida carver Reg Davidson;  mushroom foraging with Haida carver Tyson Brown and salmon fishing with Shawn Baybutt and the crew from Haida Wild.  We were overwhelmed with the hospitality that we experienced from everyone we met and completely in awe of the raw beauty of the islands.

ARC and Fairmont Waterfront are proud to partner with Haida Wild as we work together to support sustainable fishing - our goal is to source 60% of our restaurant's seafood from the pristine waters off the shores of Haida Gwaii.

TEESPRING T-Shirt Campaign LINK:
http://teespring.com/cubbeezx
ENDS Monday DECEMBER 15th!

Finally got out for a ride....it's been awhile!! Took the Grizzly and Kodiak for a rip out on the lake. The ice appears to be anywhere from 10-18 inches thick already and it isn't even officially winter yet!  As usual the first winter ride we had a few technical difficulties with the camera and mic's but not too bad.

Just a quick clip to show you what a difference a week makes.  Took the Xterra across the local ice road but it was looking pretty sketchy with all the water on it.  Still probably 3 or 4 feet of ice underneath the water but it is starting to get scary looking!

The snow was melting slowly and I guess this did turn out to be the last track ride of the season. Still some snow left around though and the lakes still have a few feet of ice on them so it may take awhile for that to melt! 
I guess Spring will get here eventually.

Check out my Veloster videos, pictures and opinions at www.velosterlover.com

I drove out to Gimli and could not resist taking my new Hyundai Veloster right out on to the ice of Lake Winnipeg.  The weather was sunny and and just below freezing,, perfect for ice fishing. I have always wanted to try ice racing and the Winnipeg Sports Car Club is scheduled to ice race on March 2,2012 at Gimli,, but I would have to buy a cheap used car for that.  

Sorry there is no drifting,, there was way too much snow on the ice that I was likely to get stuck in the middle of the lake with no tow truck service.  

Here are some pictures showing some of the setups I used make my Veloster videos.

As of March 2013 its my second winter driving in Winnipeg, mainly city driving on all season tires.  Overall I'm impressed with the traction control and even driving pretty aggressively I have only lost control once by suddenly deciding to turn causing a sideways slid before recovering with no collision.  I had planned on buying winter tires by now, but money always ends up getting spent on something else.  If I was doing more highway winter driving I definitely would have bought them by now.  In deep snow I have been stuck, but even a police car got stuck on one of those days.  I keep a small shovel and used it twice each winter.  Some people will buy an SUV just thinking they are better in winter,, but they are no safer being so high,, hitting the ditch they are more likely to role and to me an SUV is just a taller station wagon.  SUVs, station wagons and minivans still make me cringeThe Lower Grand River Flooding at Fishmasters February 14th, 2009
The water was flowing hard and fast overnight.  With an Ice Jam holding back the flow at Port Maitland, it didn't take long for the levels to rise... Thankfully we are high and dry however the water has taken over a better part of our driveway... Some on the river side of Dunnville and Broad Street didn't fare so well...

And Myself.Rapala Cruzer M2 Portable Ice Fishing Shelter Assembly - Quinte Ice Fishing Team
The Quinte Ice Fishing Team is excited to be running a fleet of the new Rapala Cruzer portable ice fishing shelters this winter.  With our "run and gun" style of fishing, these new shelters are the perfect fit.  Here is a video of us assembling one of the Rapala Cruzer M2, two person shelters.

A mobile approach to hardwater angling can greatly increase your winter success.  While fishing from shore or boat, anglers rarely cast to or sit in a static position for very long, so why do we do this come winter?  Keep moving, cover water and stay on fish! This season Rapala introduces the RapShack Cruzer series of premium ice shelters.  Aptly named, these two flip-over style models provide the utmost in mobility, comfort and functionality.

A shelter that is easily set up by one person and ready to fish in sixty seconds while being protected from all weather conditions is fundamental to a serious ice angler's approach.  Both available options, including a one-person and two-person model were designed with a combined focus on quality and durability in construction, while keeping weight at a minimum.  The sideways sled orientation provides increased fishable area along with enough headroom for unrestricted hook sets.  The tent consists of a quality, double stitched 300 Denier fabric with reinforced corners and reflective trim for night safety and a large skirt for wind resistance.  Three removable windows via Velcro fasteners offer light and the ability to keep an eye outside, yet can be covered to darken the inside when sight fishing.  It also features a mesh storage pocket, an extra-large door with YKK zippers, and a safety ventilation system to prevent moisture build-up and CO2 exposure. The sled design is light & compact and features an oversized padded seat.  For those nicer days when a wind-block is all that you need, a special lock mechanism can be used to hold the tent in an up-right position. The one-man model also features a storage shelf.

Complete this versatile ice fishing platform with additional accessories: The RapShack Cruzer Slider Kit which aids in tracking straighter and pulls easier due to reduced friction. The RapShack Cruzer Travel Cover and RapShack Tow Bar/Hitch are essential components for anglers towing behind an ATV or snowmobile. Beyond mobility, this style of shelter provides a method to store and transport your gear to your favourite ice fishing destination. Stay mobile, and catch more fish with the Rapala RapShack Cruzer series of shelters and accessories this winter.ice driving subaru impreza
This is how I warm up the car after ice fishing.  Driving my impreza outback sport on ice is a blast.  The ice is about 18 inches, and the water around 20 feet.  Large trucks are driving on the lake so I feel my little car should be fine.  The first thing to do when driving on ice is to roll down the windows and take off your seat belt.Lake of Bays, Muskoka on a the beautiful February Long Weekend! Enjoy!!!

2003 Arctic Cat 4x4 400cc Quading on Lake Winnipeg and broke through the ice. Quad floated upside down tires up exposed in the water. Lassoed the wheel and then the hitch.  

Pulled it out using a combo of 4 recovery straps and a 10,000 pound winch mounted to the front of a 9000 pound Diesel Ford Excursion.

Lesson learned. Even though the majority of the Lake was clear ice and 4ft thick. There was still thin ice.Piper Cherokee  "Annual Test Flight"  VLOG #111

Welcome back to the fishing network! Just kidding another UHC.

Welcome to UHC Season 7!
 
Minecraft: Ultra Hardcore is a gamemode originally created by Guude and the group Mindcrack.
 
In UHC mode, health does not regenerate, you must use a golden apple or instant health potion. In addition, ghasts drop gold ingots, rather than ghast tears, so players cannot brew regeneration potions.
 
In this season of UHC, we have 23 participants scattered across a 2500x2500 map playing solo using the Mumble plugin that adds directional audio in-game. The last remaining player is deemed the winner. The season was recorded in a single-session.
 
We're using a custom plugin for UHC that automatically disables PvP for the first 20 minutes and displays episode timers.

Stardew Valley is a delightful new Farm simulation RPG in a similar vein to the popular Natsume Harvest Moon series, or the Animal Crossing games, where the player takes on the role of the inheritor of an old plot of farmland in the eponymous Stardew Valley, where they are given all the tools necessary to build a life as a farmer, rancher, fisherman or even an adventurer. Befriend, even date and marry within the community, or sell the city out to the encroaching commercialism of corporate interests. The story is yours to tell.

Stardew Valley was released on February 26th, 2016, created by ConcernedApe and published by Chucklefish.

Shot using Iphone 6Frog Fishing In Canada - Michael Fromberg
An afternoon walk with April and Michael turns into a round of Canadian frog fishing of EPIC proportions! If you think frogs generally hop away at the first sign of trouble, you may be in for a surprise!Point Breeze, 2013's Ultimate Fishing Town
Point Breeze, NY was awarded the Ultimate Fishing Town by the World Fishing Network on June 26, 2013.28 6 Cabin tour, dinner of dehydrated potatoes, salmon and a fishing story Petersburg Alaska
During our mid-August week long stay in Petersburg, Alaska the weather had been damp. They had just come out of a good stretch of sunny weather in the high 70's, it was in the mid to high fifties during our stay, and as I write now 10 days later Sept. 2, 2009, they are again having sunny days. There is a great web cam that refreshes every 15 seconds perched on the National Public Radio Station tower in town. KFSK radio can be search engined, click on the web cam. We began planning our vacation in May of 2009. If I did not get a daily fix of the KFSK webcam, something was wrong. 
Much history of the community is available on-line, Google Earth posters have left numerous photos of the community. Recently I read that a group of advisors arriving in town representing the travel industry were trying to emphasize the eco-tourism appeal of the region. The Panhandle of Alaska is as wet as any equatorial region frequented by monsoons. From some of the other movies we have posted you can see the lush nature of just this one island of which there are literally hundreds, most of them unpopulated except by wildlife.  
Real Estate in the community is "By Owner", or through a local realty group named Petersburg Realty, what else? The owner of the boat rental told us he was soon selling out his boats, and would become the owner of the realty. Properties on the island ranged from undeveloped land accessible by foot through the underbrush, to undeveloped and developed properties with and without waterfront to a variety of new to older homes, several commercial properties, boats of various sizes, and a large industrial property on the shore. 
Several residents stated the loss of the logging industry, (we did note a small lumber mill in operation), and a sagging fishing revenue had produced an economic doldrums effect.  Across the street from our lodging each day we saw a representative of the self employed each day tending after his crabbing business. HIs day's activities were adjusted to the tides it seemed. Some days home in the middle of the afternoon, others not arriving until dusk. A "For Sale by Owner" sign on his two story home. 
The nations economy is shouldered by people. Each one makes a contributing share however small or large. People get bye during hard times. Petersburg did have a number of storefronts for lease on main street which the Taxi Driver told us recently were occupied by various gift trade shops. The regions Fish and Game office, a Division of Forestry office, a courthouse, a rest home, hospital, Alaska Airlines Terminal with two flights daily, air tours with fixed wing and helicopter, charter fishing boats, the Coast Guard has a large vessel tied in the harbor, nine churches, a pizza parlor, a sit down restaurant perched on pilings in Middle Harbor for sale by owner, a certain population of native coastal peoples, two taverns, a hardware with seemingly every item one could need in that area of life, an old paid for supermarket on main street, and a new un-paid for supermarket half way to the airport, and a reported full time population of 3008. Much of the payroll from the three major fish processors in town flies out of town with the globally mixed seasonal workers on "the slime line". At the area of the Harbormasters office evenings the tired workers gathered along the sidewalk. Numerous languages issued from various cliques along the way. Men and women have gone to the sea for ages, no different here. The processor business comptrollers and owners have found the minimum wage half way or so between $7 and $8 and time and a half for overtime more economical than the $11 or so paid to the unionized workers who once populated the canneries. 
We have not wintered in Petersburg. That it is a different season we can only imagine. Rain may fall in Spain, but Little Norway gets some too. Average rainfall is 99,99 inches. That is 8,3 feet per year. Knee high brown boots that have a cream colored trim are the native wear. Rain and snow visit Petersburg, and a long gray wet winter, with shortened daylight hours prevails.Loading fishing line on a newly refurbished PEETZ Classic reel
